            "Inspired by the vibrant blues of Sardinia's seas and skies, Lamborghini presented an \"Opera Unica\" Huracán Sterrato: a one-off piece of art in a unique crystal-effect paint process created by Lamborghini's Ad Personam department. Unveiled to Lamborghini guests at a VIP 60th anniversary dinner event in exclusive Porto Cervo, where the Lamborghini Lounge returns for the summer months, the one-off Huracán Sterrato also celebrates the anniversary year of Lamborghini; the brand's iconic, vibrant colors; and the company's exceptional expertise in creating unique hues and paint processes over decades.",
            "The Lamborghini Huracán Sterrato Opera Unica exudes the inimitable, brave character of the super sports car that perfectly tackles the paved and unpaved roads of the Costa Smeralda, while its unique, hand-painted exterior takes inspiration from the marine-blue landscapes and rich colors of Sardinia. The three-color hand-painted process creates the crystal effect of frozen liquid: Blu Amnis is used as the first solid paint color, and then etched into by hand with a second Blu Grifo paint and a third color Blu Fedra, in a process taking over 370 hours.",
            "\"The Huracán Sterrato was born from challenging the expected, delivering a super sports car that goes beyond convention. The one-off Huracán Sterrato Opera Unica takes this to another level, and in Lamborghini tradition, draws attention and asks questions of it as an art form,\" said Stephan Winkelmann, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Automobili Lamborghini. \"Lamborghini is always touched by the beauty and colors of Sardinia, and this is the perfect opportunity to experiment with a new paint process, explore the possibilities of our Ad Personam personalization, and then present this special Sterrato to our clients and guests in the environment that inspired the blue crystal effect.\"",
            "The exterior of the \"Opera Unica\" is finished in matt black paint, to the roof, sills and front-light casings, front and rear splitters and fenders. Its muscular, enhanced wheel-arch protection is also painted matt black, setting off Morus 19\" matt black rims. Inside, the Opera Unica one-off is as unique as the exterior: featuring exposed carbon fiber, the sports seats, door panels and console are upholstered in Blu Delphinus leather; the dashboard in same-color specially-dyed Alcantara; and the steering-wheel combining the two materials. The lighter shade of Celeste Phoebe leather is used in complementary panels, piping, and embroidery including the Lamborghini logo, recalling the blue of the exterior and the ambience of a maritime lifestyle. A seat-panel graphic is lasered in silver, and even the cover to the start-stop button on the center console is finished in the crystal effect of the exterior paint. Like all Huracán Sterrato cars to be produced, the interior carries a special plate denoting it as one of 1499 in a limited series, as well as special plates celebrating 'Opera Unica Porto Cervo 2023', finished in the crystal effect paint, and Lamborghini's 60th anniversary."

            "As its 50th anniversary celebrations continue, BMW M GmbH unleashes high performance in a form never experienced before. Innovative drive system technology, a unique vehicle concept, a door opened into a whole new market segment and the ambition to attract new groups of customers - the first-ever BMW XM wraps all these elements in a confidently dramatic exterior design that exudes power and emotion and an interior that is at once intensely driver-focused, boldly modern, and indulgently sybaritic.",
            "Powertrain - The first plug-in hybrid drive system from BMW M",
            "The all-new BMW XM is fitted with a newly developed plug-in hybrid drivetrain. The M HYBRID system in the BMW XM consists of a new 483-hp V8 engine with M TwinPower Turbo technology and a 194-hp electric motor integrated into the eight-speed M Steptronic transmission. Together, they generate a maximum system output of 644 hp at 5,400 RPM and 590 ft-lbs of torque between 1,600 and 5,000 RPM.",
            "Power is channeled to the road via the M xDrive all-wheel-drive system. The combination of an electric motor and eight-cylinder engine produces immense, instantaneously available power sustained throughout the rev range. The M HYBRID system also enables purely electric driving with an anticipated range of 30 miles (estimated range of up to 30 miles according to preliminary BMW AG tests based on the EPA's test procedure standards).",
            "The BMW XM shares its drive concept of an eight-cylinder combustion engine supported by an electric motor with the newly developed endurance racing car from BMW M Motorsport. The BMW M Hybrid V8 will go racing in the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship in North America in 2023 at venues including Daytona. The following season, it will power BMW M Motorsport's return to the FIA World Endurance Championship (WEC) and the 24 Hours of Le Mans.",
            "The extensively updated, 4.4-liter engine utilizes the thermodynamic benefits of a cross-bank exhaust manifold. A reinforced crankshaft drive, further developed turbocharging - mounted close to the exhaust manifold and with an electrically controlled blow-off valve - plus a new vane-type oil pump and a weight-minimized plastic oil sump all play a role in increasing the engine's efficiency. An optimized oil separation process with variable impactor enhances the engine's emissions performance.",
            "The VALVETRONIC fully variable valve control now includes a switchable rocker arm on the exhaust side, which allows the engines exhaust valves to be shut entirely. This way, when the driver releases the accelerator, a higher proportion of the braking energy can be fed into the high-voltage battery by means of recuperation.",
            "BMW GEN5 electric motor",
            "The V8 engine in the BMW XM is supported by an electric motor which, like the plug-in hybrid system's power electronics and high-voltage battery, is a product of fifth-generation BMW eDrive technology. The permanently excited synchronous motor is integrated into the eight-speed M Steptronic transmission and helps to provide quick throttle response.",
            "The electric motor contributes up to 194 hp to the maximum system output of 644 hp. The maximum system torque produced by the combination of electric motor and combustion engine is 590 lb-ft. A pre-gearing stage is used to increase the maximum torque produced by the electric motor to 332 lb-ft at the transmission input. This innovation enables the electric motor integrated into the transmission housing to generate substantial levels of power that could normally only be achieved using a far larger unit. Developed by BMW, the extra gearing stage between the electric motor's rotor and the transmission's input shaft gives a boost to the M HYBRID system's torque delivery. This torque is instantly on tap when pulling away and makes a clear difference both when accelerating off the line and passing at speed on the highway.",
            "Aided by the grip of M xDrive and a sophisticated launch control system, the BMW XM accelerates from 0 to 60 mph in just 4.1 seconds. Top speed is electronically limited to 155 mph, or 168 mph if the optional M Driver's Package is specified. The top speed in pure electric mode is 87 mph.",
            "BMW XM Label Red",
            "Following the launch of the BMW XM in the first quarter of 2023, BMW M will reveal a special model in the BMW XM line-up: the BMW XM Label Red. The BMW XM Label Red will be the first in a series of BMW XM Label models, and available for a limited period of time. This special model will feature over 735 bhp and 735 lb-ft of torque, unique paint, wheel, upholstery, and trim selections, and an MSRP starting over $185,000. Production of the BMW XM Label Red is expected to begin in the Summer of 2023. Details on how to order the BMW XM Label Red will be available at a later date.",
            "Power electronics",
            "The coordination of the combustion engine and electric motor is handled by the M HYBRID system's power electronics. Intelligent energy management allows the battery's charge level to be regulated so that the final stretch of a longer journey through a built-up area can be covered using only electric power, for example.",
            "The HV battery's low installation height allows it to be mounted in the underbody of the BMW XM. The lithium-ion battery offers high energy density at a cell and battery pack level. It provides a constant flow of power across a wide temperature range and under the heavy loads of performance driving. It has a net usable energy content of 25.7 kWh (29.5 kWh gross).",
            "Charging with predictive heat management",
            "The Combined Charging Unit of the M HYBRID system enables AC charging at up to 7.4 kW. This means the high-voltage battery can be replenished from zero to 100 percent charge in 3.25 hours. The Combined Charging Unit also acts as a voltage transformer to supply the 12V electrical system. Predictive heat management reduces charging times by warming or cooling the battery as needed. The system uses data on the outside temperature, predicted charging power, charge stroke between the current actual value and the target value, the car's remaining range and the distance to the destination to calculate the target temperature at which the high-voltage battery can be charged at maximum power for the longest possible time.",
            "The M HYBRID drive system in the BMW XM has a cooling system tailored to its high-performance mission. Large air apertures at the front of the BMW XM, generously sized heat exchangers, and an integrated system for controlling the temperature of the combustion engine, the transmission (including the electric motor), and the high-voltage battery ensure ideal operating temperatures for the drive system technology in everyday driving situations and under sustained high power demand. Transmission oil cooling is done by an upstream air heat exchanger. Water-carrying components have been flow-optimized to achieve maximum cooling power while keeping pumping rates low. All the heat exchangers are sealed against the surrounding structure using soft materials to enable optimal airflow.",
            "8-speed M Steptronic transmission with Drivelogic, integrated hybrid module and Launch Control function",
            "The 8-speed M Steptronic transmission with Drivelogic is also a first from BMW M. It channels not only the power generated by the combustion engine, but also the drive torque from the integrated electric motor as required to enhance either efficiency, comfort or power delivery. The hybrid module also acts as an integrated drive-off element and allows the car to creep at walking pace without the driver pressing the accelerator and firing the combustion engine.",
            "A wet multi-plate separation clutch manages the smooth engagement and disengagement of the combustion engine during a journey. Its low drag torque allows the clutch to be open when driving in pure-electric mode. Furthermore, the separation clutch can eliminate torsional vibrations generated by the combustion engine using micro-slip control. In combination with the integrated torsional vibration damper system, this helps to ensure high levels of acoustic comfort at low revs.",
            "The 8-speed M Steptronic transmission also has a Launch Control function to enable traction-optimized acceleration off the line with maximum thrust. The engine control unit governs both the release logic of the Launch Control system and the slip-optimized limitation of drive torque. The shift points are carefully calibrated help to ensure the best possible acceleration for all environmental conditions, e.g., outside temperature and road surface.",
            "Three driving modes for maximum performance and emissions-free efficiency",
            "The interaction between the combustion engine and electric motor in the BMW XM can be adjusted by selecting specific driving modes. The driver can call up the relevant menu using the M HYBRID button on the control panel in the center console and access it on the control display.",
            "HYBRID driving mode is the default setting and gives the driver access to the full system output of combustion engine and electric motor in tandem. The amount each drive source contributes to the performance experience depends on the drive configuration selected from the M Setup menu. In the Comfort setting, the electric motor is used without engaging the combustion engine as often as possible, optimizing the efficiency of the BMW XM. If the battery is at a very low state of charge, the generator function raises the engine's load point to feed additional power into the high-voltage battery. In the drive system's Sport and Sport Plus modes, the combustion engine is always active.",
            "In the ELECTRIC driving mode, the BMW XM uses only the power from the electric drive system up to its 87 mph top speed. In this mode, the combustion engine is only activated under kickdown or when switching into the transmission's manual mode - using either the gear selector or one of the shift paddles on the steering wheel.",
            "eCONTROL mode tells the system to maintain the charge of the high-voltage battery during a journey or to increase it by means of energy recuperation. In this way, battery capacity can be saved for pure-electric driving in urban areas later in the journey, for example.",
            "One engine, one electric motor, four driven wheels: the M xDrive system",
            "In the BMW XM, M xDrive splits the power generated by the combustion engine and electric motor between all four wheels precisely, quickly, and as required at all times. An electronically controlled multi-plate clutch ensures fully variable distribution of power between the front and rear axle.",
            "The rear-biased setup of M xDrive enhances the agility of the BMW XM. The system's default mode is 4WD, but two other modes can be selected via the M Setup menu. In 4WD Sport mode, more power is sent to the rear wheels for sporty, M-typical handling in dynamic driving situations. To activate 4WD Sport, the driver must first switch to M Dynamic Mode or turn DSC off. And only when DSC has been fully deactivated can 4WD Sand mode be used. This setting initiates a traction-optimized program of the all-wheel-drive system and engages the locking functions of the M Sport differential specifically for driving over dunes or similar low-traction surfaces.",
            "Model-specific rear axle differential with M Sport differential",
            "Furthering the performance of the M xDrive all-wheel-drive system is an electronically controlled differential lock in the rear axle. The M Sport differential brings a need-based and fully variable distribution of drive torque between the left and right rear wheels. This helps to send maximum drive power to the road without any losses, especially when the vehicle is being pushed hard or has less grip on one side. Shifting power to the wheel on the outside of the corner mitigates understeer without the need for brake inputs.",
            "The M xDrive system and M Sport differential are coordinated with DSC to ensure they all work together precisely as the driving situation demands. The BMW XM has a model-specific rear axle differential specially tuned to the high system torque of its M HYBRID drive system.",
            "Chassis",
            "With its long wheelbase and wide tracks, the vehicle concept underpinning the BMW XM is well-suited to delivering a balanced blend of high performance and comfort. High degrees of wheel camber at the front and rear axle enhance the handling, as do the nearly 50/50 weight distribution and the very rigid body and chassis mountings. The positioning of the M HYBRID system's high-voltage battery in the vehicle floor gives the BMW XM a low center of gravity, which has a positive effect on its agility and cornering dynamics.",
            "Its double-wishbone front axle boasts high levels of longitudinal and lateral rigidity, while the use of aluminum components reduces unsprung weight. The design includes a second level of control arms for wheel guidance, which means the dampers are almost completely isolated from lateral forces, improving damper response.",
            "The five-link rear axle ensures precise wheel guidance and outstanding straight-line poise, together with impressive ride comfort thanks to its elastic mounting. The sheet-steel construction of its links helps to reduce weight, as do the aluminum wheel carriers and forged upper control arms. The rear-axle subframe made from aluminum offers high structural rigidity and features a large supporting base along with additional thrust arms. The camber arms with aerodynamically optimized paneling on their underside form an integral part of the completely sealed underbody, thereby helping to lower aerodynamic drag and substantially reduce rear axle lift.",
            "The BMW XM is equipped with steel springs that have been designed to meet the requirements of a high-performance model's handling dynamics and offer high levels of roll and vertical stabilization while also minimizing weight. Linear springs are fitted at the front axle and progressive springs at the rear. The progressive springs offer very long rebound travel combined with high oscillation rates, benefiting not only traction, but ride comfort for passengers in the rear.",
            "The BMW XM comes standard with Adaptive M Suspension Professional.",
            "Active roll stabilization with Active Roll Comfort",
            "An important factor in the inspiring handling of the BMW XM is its active roll stabilization technology. The version of the electromechanical roll stabilization system found on the BMW XM uses a 48V electric motor as an active connection between the two halves of the anti-roll bar at both the front and rear axle. A dedicated 48V electrical system made up of supercapacitors supplies energy to the electric motors for the active anti-roll bars.",
            "The active roll stabilization also increases comfort when driving in a straight line by decoupling the fixed connection of a conventional anti-roll bar between each axle's wheels. This has the effect of correcting body roll when driving over surface imperfections on one side of the vehicle, also lessening the associated acceleration forces and the obtrusive 'head-toss' they can cause.",
            "The Active Roll Comfort function goes further by enabling the system to actively suppress rolling movements caused by bumps in the road on one side of the vehicle rather than just reduce them. This allows any loss of ride comfort on rough roads to be minimized more effectively.",
            "Premiere in a BMW M model: Integral Active Steering",
            "For the first time in a BMW M model, Integral Active Steering is fitted as standard equipment. Turning the rear wheels as well as the fronts makes light work of tight, low-speed maneuvers, increases agility at moderate speeds, and enhances poise and assurance at high speeds, especially when changing lanes. The rear wheels are turned in either the same or the opposite direction to the front wheels, depending on road speed. And in very challenging driving situations, stabilizing steering inputs at the rear wheels can help to keep the BMW XM safely on track.",
            "Near-actuator wheel slip limitation",
            "The superb traction and precisely controllable handling of the BMW XM in any situation are enhanced by means of the very latest, intelligently interconnected control systems. The near-actuator wheel slip limitation maximizes directional stability even when driving in adverse road conditions. This traction control system is integrated into the engine management, eliminating the long signal paths to the DSC control unit. This allows corrective inputs to be applied up to ten times faster than in conventional systems and with exceptional precision. Because the near-actuator wheel slip limitation function manages any loss of traction, especially when accelerating hard or taking corners at speed, the DSC system has to intervene far less frequently to maintain composed and assured handling with selective applications of the brakes at individual wheels.",
            "23-inch M light-alloy wheels and sports tires",
            "Standard on the BMW XM are 23-inch M light-alloy wheels fitted with mixed-size high-performance tires measuring 275/35 R23 at the front and 315/30 R23 at the rear. M light-alloy wheels in 22-inch diameters are optional.",
            "Exterior Design",
            "The progressive front-end design developed exclusively for the BMW luxury class has been given a unique adaptation for the BMW XM, announcing both its presence and remarkable performance equally. Smooth surfaces and sharp edges bring clarity and confidence to the front end. Alongside the fresh interpretation of the twin headlights and BMW M kidney grille, the large air intakes are a defining feature of the front end. The sensor and camera systems required for the driver assistance tech are integrated discreetly into the front apron.",
            "The BMW XM is equipped as standard with Adaptive LED Headlights, whose light functions are split into two separate areas. The daytime driving lights, side lights and turn indicators are integrated into the ultra-slim, crisply contoured upper elements, each consisting of two LED units. The low-beam and high-beam headlights are positioned in the lower, darkened area of the headlight units deeply embedded in the front apron.",
            "The two elements of the grille stand out clearly from the surrounding surfaces. Within them are the horizontal grille bars that have become a hallmark feature of the high-performance sports cars from BMW M GmbH, while the double surrounds of the kidneys emphasize their octagonal contours. The outer border of each kidney is finished in high-gloss black, while the inner surround provides contour lighting in the form of a sharply drawn, unbroken light ring.",
            "The side window shape is bordered by a high-gloss black accent band. Another black accent band emerges from the front wheel arches, and as it approaches the D-pillar the band turns upwards in a fresh imagining of the Hofmeister kink.",
            "There is a prominent depression at the rear of the BMW XM's roof and BMW logos have been engraved into the rear window below the right and left rails. A special laser engraving technique ensures the logos stand out against the dark glass surface.",
            "The flat, near seamlessly fitted rear window and prominently flared wheel arches together accentuate the width and powerful stature of the BMW XM. The slim rear lights have a sculpted design and project out from the body. The rear lights only become visible through the dark lens covers when they are activated. Three diagonal light strips on the flanks reference the style of the BMW M GmbH tricolor logo",
            "Vertically arranged reflectors border the rear apron at either side. The diffuser elements integrated into the lower section of the rear apron are painted in Black high-gloss and framed by high-gloss black surrounds. The black model badge on the tailgate is outlined in gold. A pair of tailpipes from the double-sided, dual-branch exhaust system protrude from either side of the diffuser. This familiar design cue of M models has been reimagined for the BMW XM, with the hexagonal tailpipe trims stacked vertically. Model-specific air-directing elements in the underbody provide additional cooling for the exhaust system, enabling an optimal operating temperature at all times - even when the engine is working under high loads for sustained periods.",
            "Rich, vibrant paint finishes; up to 23-inch light-alloy wheels",
            "Seven paint shades are available for the exterior of the BMW XM, including three shades exclusive to M models and one BMW Individual finish. Further options are expected to be added in summer 2023, at which time customers also will be able to choose from more than 50 BMW Individual paint finishes.",
            "The BMW XM can be ordered with NightGold Metallic exterior trim. If this option is specified, the accent band along the sides of the vehicle, the BMW M kidney grille's outer border, and the surrounds for the diffuser elements at the rear are finished in NightGold.",
            "The BMW XM is fitted as standard with 23-inch M light-alloy wheels. Available as an option are 22-inch M aerodynamic wheels with inserts that reduce both weight and drag. Customers may also choose 23-inch bi-color M light-alloy wheels. These are finished either in Black or Night Gold and feature a unique hub cover with BMW lettering.",
            "Interior Design",
            "The expressive style of the BMW XM's exterior design continues inside the cabin. The lines and surfaces of the instrument panel, center console, seats, and door trim panels create an environment around the driver and front passenger seats that authentically reflects the performance potential of the BMW XM.",
            "The BMW Curved Display sits on a generously-sized decorative surface in matte carbon fiber. The M-typical carbon fiber elements in the instrument panel combine with wide air vent surrounds in pearl-effect chrome. The surface of the center console is also in matte carbon fiber.",
            "Progressive luxury: M Lounge in the rear, sculptural headliner",
            "A generous feeling of space, high-quality materials, and bold design transform the rear of the BMW XM into an exclusive M Lounge. The rear bench offers two outboard seats and a full-size space for a third passenger in the center. Deep recesses and a color and material design that continues into the door trim panels combine to create an inviting lounge-like character in the rear seats with a snug and comfortable feel.

            "The second generation of the BMW M2 excites and delights with the skillset of a classical high-performance sports car - reproduced in highly concentrated form, with fresh intensity and cutting-edge technology. The new M2 encapsulates the pure joy of driving; its compact dimensions, a six-cylinder in-line engine, a manual gearbox, rear-wheel drive and an advanced control/operating concept - allowing the driver to adjust the vehicle setup as desired - are all central to its appeal. At the heart of the vehicle concept are fleet-footed agility on demand and handling that remains easily controllable even as the driver explores the coupé's limits. The distinct character profile of the new BMW M2 is reflected in a visually powerful design that makes no secret of the car's comfortably segment-leading power, even before it turns a wheel.",
            "The new BMW M2 represents another highlight event in the model offensive celebrating the 50-year anniversary of BMW M GmbH. The new edition of the coupé makes the first step into the world of highperformance sports cars at BMW M GmbH even more beguiling. The two-door machine embodies an unadulterated racing passion that owners can enjoy day in, day out. Its powertrain technology and chassis configuration, and the aerodynamic balance of its body, have been crafted into a precisely interwoven whole during in-depth testing on the Nürburgring's Nordschleife circuit and other race tracks.",
            "The new BMW M2 builds on the brand's tradition of ultra-sporty models with compact dimensions. Back in 1973 there was the boldly unique BMW 2002 turbo. And in 2011, BMW M GmbH took the concept to the next level with the development of its first high-performance model for the premium compact segment. The BMW 1-Series M Coupé met with an overwhelming response and posted sales figures that comfortably outstripped original expectations. However, even this level of success was easily overshadowed by the first-generation BMW M2 unveiled in 2015. As well as amassing a fine collection of awards, the original M2 did not take long after launch to become the largest-selling model in the BMW M line-up. Almost 60,000 examples in total were delivered to fans around the world.",
            "The worldwide launch of the new BMW M2 will get underway in April 2023. The most important sales markets will be Germany and the USA, followed by Great Britain, China and Japan. The new BMW M2 will be built for customers in every world market alongside the new BMW 2-Series Coupé at the BMW Group's San Luis Potosí plant in Mexico.",
            "Compact dimensions, extremely powerful proportions",
            "The expressive looks of the new BMW M2 act as a clear signpost to sporty driving pleasure and stem primarily from its extremely powerful proportions. These are showcased particularly well by the two-door car's compact dimensions. Measuring 4,580 millimetres from nose to tail, 1,887 millimetres wide and 1,403 millimetres in height, it boasts dynamic coupé proportions. The new M2 is therefore 119 millimetres longer than its predecessor, 16 millimetres wider and 11 millimetres lower. It is 214 millimetres shorter than the BMW M4 Coupé models.",
            "The 2,747-millimetre wheelbase of the new BMW M2 makes a particularly prominent contribution to its fingertip agility. It is 110 millimetres shorter than that of the BMW M4 Coupé but 54 millimetres longer than the predecessor model's, benefitting legroom in both rows of seats. Its track widths have increased by 38 millimetres (to 1,617 millimetres) at the front and 4 millimetres (to 1,605 millimetres) at the rear. This means they precisely match the figures for the BMW M4 Coupé, which further highlights the difference in dimensions compared with the BMW 2-Series Coupé: the highperformance model is 49 millimetres wider, with a 44-millimetre wider track at the front and 18-millimetre wider track at the rear.",
            "M-specific design features accentuate the performance-led character",
            "The extremely athletic proportions of the new BMW M2 combine with clearly designed surfaces and powerfully sculpted forms. This produces an emotionally engaging aesthetic, which accentuates the wide stance of the new BMW M2 in particular. The car's standalone appearance with clear differentiation from the BMW 2-Series Coupé is also emphasised by the M-specific design features firmly invested in the functional requirements of cooling air routing and aerodynamic balance.",
            "The front end of the new BMW M2 is headlined by its large, horizontal and frameless BMW kidney grille. The elements of the M-typical threesection lower air intake have almost rectangular contours and optimise cooling of the powertrain components and brakes. The boldly contoured headlight units are positioned to the outer edges of the front end. Inspired by the legendary BMW 02 models, they each have a single circular headlight using full-LED technology for both low beam and high beam. The dark background of the lights clearly showcases the advanced technology at work. The daytime driving lights take the form of U-shaped light guides at the lower edge of the headlights, in which the turn indicators are also integrated. Available as options are Adaptive LED Headlights with BMW Selective Beam non-dazzling High-beam Assistant and M lights Shadow Line with dark inlays.",
            "Muscular wheel arches, optional carbon-fibre roof",
            "Prominently flared side skirts team up with broad, muscular wheel arches to create an appearance that is characteristic of BMW M and inspired by racing cars. The car's silhouette is shaped by its long bonnet, short overhangs and set-back passenger compartment. The roofline swooping down dynamically from the B-pillar, and the short boot lid culminating in a pronounced spoiler lip, complete the image of a compact BMW coupé with its sporting appeal dialled up a few extra notches.",
            "Customers can specify their new BMW M2 with an M Carbon roof as an option. The use of this extremely lightweight high-tech material for the roof reduces the vehicle weight by around six kilograms. The car's centre of gravity is also lower as a result, which further enhances its handling agility. With its dark colouring, the exposed structure of its carbon-fibrereinforced plastic (CFRP), and a central cut-out, the M Carbon roof makes a striking visual impression too.",
            "Rear diffuser with pure-bred racing authenticity",
            "Horizontally pronounced surfaces give the rear end of the new BMW M2 its structure. These surfaces get their M-specific looks from the vertically arranged reflectors set deep into the outer edges of the rear apron, and a rear spoiler lip designed to generate additional downforce at the rear axle. The most eye-catching element of the rear end is the pronounced diffuser insert, which reaches down a long way towards the road. This air-directing element adopts a pared-back racing look and incorporates another signature M feature: the two pairs of exhaust tailpipes. By comparison with other BMW M models, these are positioned a significant distance from the edges of the rear end and - together with the headturning diffuser - compose a powerfully compact rear view.",
            "Exterior paint finishes and light-alloy wheels provide distinctive touches",
            "Customers purchasing the new BMW M2 can choose from two solid and three metallic exterior paint shades. The selection comprises Alpine White solid, Sapphire Black metallic and Brooklyn Grey metallic, plus the Toronto Red metallic and Zandvoort Blue solid shades available exclusively for the compact high-performance sports car.",
            "Standard specification for the new BMW M2 includes exclusively designed double-spoke M light-alloy wheels with a bi-colour finish. Measuring 19 inches at the front axle and 20 inches at the rear, they further enhance the car's agile performance attributes. A selection of other M light-alloy wheels can be specified as options in the same format. In addition, the range of BMW M Performance Parts features M Performance light-alloy wheels in 20/21-inch format.",
            "M TwinPower Turbo six-cylinder in-line engine, manual gearbox and rear-wheel drive deliver top-class performance in classical style",
            "The powertrain technology in the new BMW M2 brings elite performance to the premium compact segment and serves up an intoxicating driving experience in the style of a classical high-performance sports car. The M2 is the only model in its segment to be offered with a six-cylinder inline engine, which impresses not only with its inimitable performance characteristics but also its clearly superior power. The engine joins forces with either a dynamic eight-speed M Steptronic transmission with Drivelogic or a six-speed manual gearbox specialising in driving pleasure for a higher grade of purist. In both cases, the engine's power is fed through to the road in traditional fashion via the rear wheels.",
            "Developing a maximum 338 kW/460 hp from its six-cylinder in-line engine, the new BMW M2 stands at the pinnacle of the compact highperformance segment. Added to which, its engine outguns the base unit used by its predecessor by 66 kW/90 hp. The 3.0-litre unit differs only in a small number of details from the engine employed in the BMW M3/BMW M4 models.",
            "M-typical qualities: instantaneous power delivery, high-revving character",
            "The straight-six engine once again captures the imagination with its hallmark M attributes in the version developed for the BMW M2. It combines the latest M TwinPower Turbo technology with the highrevving character drivers have come to expect of an M car. Peak torque of 550 Nm (405 lb-ft) is produced between 2,650 and 5,870 rpm and maximum output arrives at 6,250 rpm. Urgent response, a healthy appetite for revs and linear power delivery into the highest reaches of the engine speed range together form an unmistakable skillset that defines the performance experience in the new BMW M2. The engine revs to a maximum 7,200 rpm.",
            "The design principle behind the six-cylinder in-line engine and its technical details reflect the decades of experience amassed by BMW M GmbH in motor sport. An extremely rigid crankcase, friction-optimised cylinder bores, a crankshaft drive with high torsional rigidity and a forged crankshaft with lightweight design enhance the efficiency, power development and high-revving nature of the six-cylinder in-line engine.",
            "The core of the cylinder head is 3D printed, enabling a weight reduction and optimised coolant duct routing.",
            "Two mono-scroll turbochargers supply compressed air to the combustion chambers. The turbocharging system also features an indirect intercooler and an electronically controlled wastegate. Other elements of M TwinPower Turbo technology are High Precision Injection, which works with maximum pressure of 350 bar, VALVETRONIC variable valve timing and Double-VANOS fully variable camshaft timing.",
            "Track-spec cooling and oil supply systems, M-specific exhaust system",
            "The M-specific cooling system is supplied with fresh air channelled through large apertures in the front apron and it ensures the powertrain components maintain an optimal operating temperature at all times - both in everyday use over short distances or in urban areas, and during high-speed outings on the track. The oil supply system is also designed to handle extremely dynamic driving situations. An oil sump with two separate chambers and an additional suction stage allow the mapcontrolled oil pump to keep lubricant flowing reliably even under extreme lateral and longitudinal acceleration.",
            "The M-specific exhaust system with electrically controlled flaps generates an emotionally rich soundtrack, providing an acoustic showcase for the engine's free-revving performance and linear build-up of power. It terminates in a large silencer, from which the exhaust gases escape via a quartet of tailpipes in customary BMW M fashion.",
            "A choice of power delivery: an eight-speed M Steptronic transmission with Drivelogic or a six-speed manual gearbox",
            "The new BMW M2 comes as standard with an eight-speed M Steptronic transmission with Drivelogic. However, as an option its six-cylinder inline engine can also link up with a six-speed manual gearbox, creating a performance experience in the classical mould, rooted in the intense interaction between the driver and car. The gear ratios and gear spread are perfectly matched to the performance characteristics of the engine. A precisely defined shift action enables rapid, easily executed gear changes. Plus, the Gear Shift Assistant uses engagement speed control to ensure slip-free operation when downshifting under braking into corners. It can be deactivated in the M Setup menu.",
            "The standard eight-speed M Steptronic transmission is also distinguished by ratio spacing perfectly attuned to the engine's characteristics and also offers extremely sporty gear shifts. The broadly spread gears assist efficiency at low engine speeds while enabling an intense build-up of power from low road speeds. The automatic transmission's further developed converter technology reduces rotational irregularities and enables a particularly direct connection to the engine.",
            "As well as the new-look selector lever, there are also shift paddles on the steering wheel for performing manual shifts with sequential gear selection. It is also possible to execute multiple downshifts to the lowest available gear in manual mode for a sudden burst of acceleration from a steady speed. This is done by simply pulling on the left shift paddle while summoning maximum power by pressing the accelerator to the floor. M Steptronic does not force upshifts under acceleration in manual mode - even when the engine's revs hit the limiter.",
            "The transmission's shift characteristics can be varied using the Drivelogic button integrated into the selector lever, with a choice of three clearly distinguishable settings available in both automated and manual mode. Besides a more comfort-oriented setup and a setting for sporty driving, drivers are also able to activate a track-optimised configuration for the shift characteristics.",
            "The decision between shifting gears in traditional style and using the Mspecific automatic transmission for the job is a question of personal preference, but it will only have a minor effect on the performance attributes of the new BMW M2. Examples fitted with the optional sixspeed manual gearbox accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h (62 mph) in 4.3 seconds, while cars with the eight-speed M Steptronic transmission complete the same sprint in 4.1 seconds. The new BMW M2 powers from 0 to 200 km/h (124 mph) in 14.3 seconds (automatic: 13.5 seconds). Top speed is electronically limited to 250 km/h (155 mph), although this can be raised to 285 km/h (177 mph) if the optional M Driver's Package is specified.",
            "Supreme dynamics, optimal traction: rear-wheel drive and the Active M Differential",
            "By sending its power to the rear wheels, the new BMW M2 is embracing the traditional recipe for converting engine output into dynamic performance. When pushing hard on the track, the driver can use the linear build-up of lateral acceleration forces characteristic of M models to guide the car through corners with controlled drifts.",
            "Another contributor to the sublime dynamics of the BMW M2 is the Active M Differential at the rear axle, which is part of standard specification. It can halt rotational speed compensation between the rear wheels whenever required and generate a locking effect of up to 100 per cent seamlessly and variably. This optimises traction on road surfaces offering different levels of adhesion for the left- and right-hand rear wheel. The differential lock ensures drive torque is not lost through slip at one or other rear wheel, but can instead be utilised to pull away more quickly. The Active M Differential is networked with the DSC (Dynamic Stability Control) system and adapts its locking effect precisely to the driving situation at hand, as detected by an array of sensors. Among the factors taken into account here are drive torque, wheel speed, driving speed and lateral acceleration, as well as the car's steering angle and yaw rate. This allows the degree of lock to be adjusted extremely precisely and predictably for the driver. For example, when accelerating hard out of corners, they are given tangible feedback on the grip available at the rear wheels and can therefore apply just the right amount of throttle required.",
            "A new dimension in agility",
            "Dynamic élan, agility and precision are defining traits of every highperformance sports car from BMW M GmbH. With its exceptionally sharp responses to every movement of the accelerator and steering wheel, the new BMW M2 shines the spotlight clearly on handling agility. Sophisticated chassis technology originally developed for the BMW M3/BMW M4 endows the M2 with all the tools required to convert the power of its straight-six engine into sublime straight-line and lateral performance, both in everyday driving and out on the track. At the same time, the compact dimensions, short wheelbase, excellent longitudinal and torsional stiffness of the body and chassis mountings, and the almost perfectly balanced 50:50 weight distribution, combine to deliver precisely controllable, fingertip handling. Add classical rear-wheel drive to the mix and the result is driving pleasure of incomparable purity.",
            "During an exhaustive development process that harnessed the racing expertise of BMW M GmbH, the chassis technology was precisely tuned to the engine's specific performance characteristics as well as the compact two-door car's overall concept and its aerodynamic balance. This involved the BMW M2 completing thousands of miles of testing while still at the prototype stage at the BMW Group's test centre in Miramas in southern France, the winter test centre in Arjeplog, Sweden and the Nürburgring's Nordschleife circuit, along with other race circuits. This programme of testing was complemented by fine-tuning on motorways and country roads as well as in everyday urban traffic to ensure that drivers of the new BMW M2 experience a new expression of agility clearly distinct from that offered by either its predecessor or its present-day rivals.",
            "M-specific bracing and chassis components",
            "The torsional stiffness of the front end is further increased by bespoke links connecting the individual spring strut towers both with one another and with the nose of the car and bulkhead. Vertical braces connect the stiffening elements of the engine compartment to the front axle subframe, whose supporting base has been enlarged by the addition of a bespoke attachment point at the base of the A-pillars. The M-specific aluminium front axle subframe is given extra rigidity by a single-piece aluminium shear panel with integral sill braces. The centre and rear sections of the body incorporate model-specific C-pillar reinforcements and luggage compartment stiffening elements, together with a threepiece rear axle shear panel and a rear axle subframe with a rigid connection to the body.",
            "The wheel suspension on the new BMW M2 has M-specific kinematic and elastokinematic properties, which combine with the exceptionally large castor and kingpin angles and the lowered roll centre to produce the trademark M blend of extremely dynamic handling and finely judged comfort-focused characteristics. The M-specific version of the doublejoint spring strut front axle comprises aluminium wishbones with ball joints, a likewise aluminium torque arm with newly developed mounting, a forged swivel bearing with bespoke spring strut clamp and lightweight wheel bearings with very high camber stability. The five-link rear axle with M-specific upgrades provides the ideal basis for direct, highprecision response in highly dynamic driving situations with its wide track and rigid mounting.",
            "M Servotronic steering and adaptive M suspension as standard",
            "The M Servotronic steering facilitates accurate turn-in when powering through bends on the one hand and effortless parking and manoeuvring on the other. It does so by combining the benefits of speed-sensitive power assistance and a variable steering ratio. There is a choice of two settings for steering response in the M Setup menu. Comfort mode combines a light steering feel with precise feedback. And in the Sport setting the steering becomes much more communicative while also requiring notably more force to turn the wheel - for maximum precision when exploring the outer reaches of the car's dynamic repertoire.",
            "The adaptive M suspension that also comes as standard features electronically controlled dampers designed to maximise road contact and traction in all driving situations. The dampers are controlled with the help of sensors that keep a constant eye on body movements, the condition of the road and steering adjustments. Electromagnetically controlled valves generate fully variable damping forces for each individual wheel, as required and with split-second speed. The basic damper characteristics can be varied as desired by selecting one of the three settings in the M Setup menu.",
            "Integrated braking system with two settings for pedal feel; M lightalloy wheels measuring 19 inches at the front and 20 inches at the rear",
            "The M Compound brakes on the new BMW M2 - comprising six-piston, fixed-calliper brakes with 380-millimetre discs at the front wheels and their single-piston, floating-calliper counterparts with integrated parking brake and 370-millimetre discs at the rear - deliver outstanding stopping power. The callipers are painted in Blue metallic as standard, with a Red finish available as an option.",
            "The integrated braking system slows the car down with great precision. This system brings together the brake activation, brake booster and braking control functions within a compact module. The required brake pressure is triggered exceptionally quickly and precisely using an electric actuator. Here, the integrated braking system is fitted in an M-specific version that presents the driver with two pedal feel settings, allowing them to choose between more comfort-oriented or very direct execution of brake pedal inputs in the M Setup menu.",
            "Also on the standard equipment roster for the new BMW M2 are M lightalloy wheels, which have a larger diameter at the rear axle. This results in extremely effective transmission of lateral control forces at the driven wheels, making it possible to extract even more from the compact highperformance sports car's dynamic handling potential. The new BMW M2 comes with 19-inch light-alloy wheels at the front and 20-inch items at the rear, each representing an increase of one inch on the diameter of the wheels fitted as standard on the BMW M3 and BMW M4 models.",
            "They are shod with tyres measuring 275/35 ZR19 and 285/30 ZR20 at the front and rear respectively. There is also the option of combining the M light-alloy wheels with track tyres that have been specially designed for use on race circuits.",
            "M Drive Professional with M Traction Control also fitted as standard",
            "The inclusion of the integrated braking system enables the DSC (Dynamic Stability Control) system to act with even greater dynamism and precision. Its range of functions includes M Dynamic Mode, which allows extra wheel slip at the push of a button to induce an exceptionally sporty driving experience. The wheel slip limitation function has been integrated into the engine management on the new BMW M2. This eliminates the long signal paths to the DSC control unit, meaning that the corrective inputs are applied up to ten times faster than in conventional systems and with exceptional precision. Any loss of traction, either when accelerating on road surfaces offering varying or limited amounts of grip or while cornering, is therefore nipped in the bud, meaning that the DSC system has to intervene far less frequently with selective applications of the brakes at individual wheels.",
            "The M Traction Control function included as part of the standardspecification M Drive Professional allows drivers of the new BMW M2 to set individual intervention thresholds for wheel slip limitation; they can choose from ten stages of precisely defined slip permitted at the driven wheels. During outings on the track, drivers can therefore carefully reduce the extent of control system inputs in order to configure a setup for controlled drifts that is precisely tailored to both track surface conditions and their personal preferences.",
            "Attractive standard specification and a focused selection of options",
            "When it comes to functionality, control/operation and comfort, the standard equipment features in the new BMW M2 follow the lead of its powertrain and chassis technology by placing the emphasis squarely on focused driving pleasure. The compact high-performance sports car's cockpit with its driver-centric design features M-specific readouts, controls and setup options, as well as the advanced BMW Curved Display. The inclusion of M Drive Professional as standard allows drivers to hone their skills at the wheel of the new BMW M2 with functions such as the M Drift Analyser and M Laptimer while revelling in authentic racing flair.",
            "As a result, the advances over the outgoing model are evident not just from the car's sharper performance but also its far more extensive standard specification. A focused selection of options is available for enhancing driving comfort or adding visual flourishes to both the exterior and interior, allowing owners to customise their new BMW M2 in just the ways they want. One standout optional extra is the bespoke M Race Track Package that is designed to maximise the performance experience.",
            "Racing flair on demand: redesigned M Sport seats and M Carbon bucket seats",
            "The standard sport seats in the new BMW M2 provide both excellent long-distance comfort and notable lateral support when powering through corners. Their design includes model-specific touches in the form of the Sensatec/Alcantara upholstery for the seat surfaces and the embossed \"M2\" badge at the top of the backrest. They can be optionally specified with seat heating as well as electric adjustment for the seats' fore/aft position, tilt and height. The driver's seat also gets electric backrest width and angle adjustment, complete with a memory function.",
            "There is also the option of newly designed and exclusive M Sport seats with even more pronounced side bolsters and contour lines around the backrest and head restraint in BMW M GmbH colours. They are upholstered in Vernasca leather/Sensatec with perforated surfaces and can be ordered in either Black or Cognac. Their integral head restraints feature an illuminated M logo. The M Sport seats likewise come with electrical adjustment, including for the height of the head restraints. Also available are M seat belts with a woven stripe pattern in BMW M GmbH colours.",
            "The M Carbon bucket seats - also found on the options list for the new BMW M2 - radiate pure racing flair as soon as the doors are opened. Also fully electric and heated, they feature integral head restraints and an illuminated model badge. The Merino leather covering the seat surfaces increases comfort, while removable head restraints and a facility for adding a multi-point harness underline the racing credentials of the M Carbon bucket seats. The use of carbon fibre-reinforced plastic (CFRP) in the structural elements of the seat cushion and backrest together with the cut-outs in the side bolsters and below the head restraints saves 10.8 kilograms over the M Sport seats.",
            "The Easy-Entry function slides the front seats forward in a controlled movement when the backrests are folded, making it easier for passengers to access the rear compartment. The contours and integral head restraints of the two rear seats give them an individual-seat character, allowing passengers in the rear to enjoy a sense of sporty driving pleasure as well. The rear backrest has a 40:20:40 split, allowing one or more sections to be folded down as necessary in order to accommodate very long items of luggage. When the backrest is upright, the new BMW M2 offers 390 litres of boot space.",
            "Customers wishing to inject the cabin of the new BMW M2 with even greater sporting panache can opt for M interior trim strips in Aluminium Rhombicle anthracite as an alternative to the standard trim strips in Black high-gloss. If the M interior trim strips in Carbon Fibre that are also optionally available are specified, the shift paddles and trim on the M leather steering wheel will have a CFRP finish too.",

The new BMW M2 is essentially turned into another digital and connected device in the customer's ecosystem. Mobile reception for both data and phone calls is significantly improved by the vehicle's own 5G antenna system. Up to ten devices can access the internet at any one time via the mobile hotspot.",
            "The Personal eSIM is linked to the customer's BMW ID rather than their car - meaning it can be transferred to other BMW vehicles with Personal eSIM functionality.

            "Perfecting the Spectrum Theme required the development of new techniques that introduce a new-generation of McLaren paint specialism, offering customers something truly unique and ground-breaking.",
            "More technical than anything MSO has developed before, Spectrum Theme shares its philosophy with the far-reaching technical changes introduced on 750S. Separate shades of colour create a tonal shift defined by precision craftsmanship; to the naked eye, the close bunching of colours produces an illusion of light to dark within each individual stripe which in turn gives a sense of speed and acceleration, even when the 750S is stationary.",
            "\"The Spectrum Theme takes what we can do at McLaren to the next level. A huge degree of attention and accuracy is required to ensure the lines of the Spectrum are completely sympathetic to the surface of the 750S's incredible bodywork, and the new techniques we've developed to achieve this are a perfect match for the 750's wide-ranging technical advances. The increasing complexity of what we can offer to customers, through themes like Spectrum, is testament to the incredible experience and expertise of our paint technicians at MSO.\" Michael McDonagh, Director, McLaren Special Operations",

            "The Blue, Grey and Orange themes are only the beginning; Spectrum can also be specified in unique colourways, designed and delivered by MSO. The shades in the colour-spectrum require formulation of new paints that blend just the right amount of light and dark tone to create a coherent shift in colour. There is no fixed formula, instead every Spectrum Theme demanding bespoke mixes of these blends to achieve the desired outcome.",
            "Consideration of the shut lines and intricate aerodynamic sculpting of the dihedral doors was a particular challenge for the MSO technicians placing the Spectrum lines. At the rear of the car, Spectrum Theme incorporates a visual acknowledgement of the popular Velocity Theme also offered by MSO. The seventh paint shade is not a solid stripe, but a gentle Velocity fade that wraps around the back of the 750S. The Blue theme grades from Spectrum Blue to Metallic Aurora Blue, the Orange theme begins with Spectrum Orange and builds to a rich potent Gamma Red Metallic and the Grey variant shifts from Spectrum Grey to Metallic Meteorite Grey. And as a final flourish, the underside of the Active Rear Wing of the 750S can be finished in a contrasting colour."

Since its introduction in the U.S. market in 1958, the Land Cruiser evolved over the years from the legendary two-door models like the 40 Series with its fold-down front windshield, white roof, and rear jump seats to the capable yet fully loaded 200 Series, which was the last generation to be sold in the States and combined Land Cruiser's unbreakable strength with premium luxury features. Now, Land Cruiser stays true to its heritage, returning as a high-quality off-roader at a more accessible price point that will take a wider range of customers on numerous backcountry adventures across the globe.",
            "Built on the TNGA-F global truck platform, the new Land Cruiser is designed, engineered, and tested to survive in the harshest of environments. For this new generation, Land Cruiser is exclusively available with the range-topping i-FORCE MAX hybrid powertrain producing 326 horsepower and 465 lb.-ft. of torque. It's slightly smaller and narrower than the outgoing 200 Series model, making it nimbler on the trails, and Land Cruiser features off-road tech that has debuted on the newest generation of Toyota trucks. Limited to 5,000 units for the first two months of production, Land Cruiser will be offered in a First Edition grade that includes two new two-tone paint colors and additional off-road equipment.",

When Land Cruiser arrived in the U.S. in the late '50s, Toyota sold only one unit in its first year. But then, when the 40 Series arrived, Land Cruiser became the best-selling Toyota in the U.S. for five years running. These early models featured solid front and rear axles on leaf springs, and the boxy look with a flat roof, short overhangs, and \"TOYOTA\" grilles became iconic. Soon after, though, customers wanted a bigger 4×4, and the Land Cruiser grew into larger station wagon models such as the 55 and 60 Series and ultimately lead to where the Land Cruiser left off in the U.S.: the 200 Series, a premium, full-size luxury off-road SUV.",

This new ladder frame allows for more rigidity in the chassis compared to the 200 Series model thanks to the use of high-strength steel with blanking and laser welds. Compared to the outgoing 200 Series, the new Land Cruiser is 4.4 inches narrower and 1.2 inches shorter for more off-road prowess.",

            "Toyota Motor Corporation (Toyota) has unveiled the new Land Cruiser \"250\" Series to the world, with the launch planned for the first half of 2024 in Japan.",
            "A vehicle that allows people to go anywhere and everywhere and return safely, developed and refined over more than 70 years based on the actual usage situations of global customers",
            "Launched originally as the Toyota BJ on August 1, 1951, the Land Cruiser series is now 72 years old. Immediately after its launch, it became the first vehicle to climb to the sixth station of Mount Fuji. From that time, it has fulfilled its mission of delivering safety and security to all types of people in places that can only be reached in the Land Cruiser. Developed and refined based on the actual usage situations of global customers, it provides reliability, durability, and off-road performance that allows people to go anywhere and everywhere and return safely. This concept has been passed down and evolved. With cumulative sales of about 11.3 million units in approximately 170 countries and regions around the world, it has supported the lives and livelihoods of people everywhere.",
            "Until now, the Land Cruiser range has been divided into three different series-the Station Wagon that always showcases the latest technologies and has evolved into the flagship model (currently the 300 Series), the Heavy-Duty model with outstanding durability and off-road driving performance (the 70 Series), and the Light Duty model that provides ease of handling and comfort on an off-road base as a lifestyle and practical choice for customers (Prado).",
            "250 Series, back to the origin and essence of the Land Cruiser",
            "The Light Duty Series has tended to shift toward high-end and luxury models as the generations have evolved. In developing the 250 Series, then-President Akio Toyoda, who has the ultimate responsibility for product development, explained his basic approach as, \"The Land Cruiser should be a car that supports people's lives and local communities, so the Light Duty model must return to the true form that customers are looking for.\" In response, the development team defined the concept as returning to the origin of the Land Cruiser. With the spirit of rebuilding the model, they created a simple and sturdy vehicle that can be trusted by customers to fulfill their lifestyle choices and practical needs.",
            "The new 250 Series is a core Land Cruiser model with the same GA-F platform as the 300 Series to dramatically improve basic performance as an off-roader. It also comes with various powertrains to achieve even more powerful driving performance and environmental performance worthy of the Land Cruiser name. It was created in pursuit of unique Land Cruiser characteristics, incorporating interior and exterior styling that fuses traditional and modern in a functional package. The aim was to create a next-generation Land Cruiser with improved ease of handling and comfort for both on- and off-road driving, while also delivering class-leading advanced safety performance.",
            "Even after the 250 Series is released, the Land Cruiser will continue to evolve, while meeting a range of social needs, as a trustworthy, reliable, and practical choice for customers worldwide.",
            "Improved basic performance as an off-roader through adoption of the GA-F platform",
            "With the same GA-F platform as the 300 Series, the new 250 Series has dramatically improved off-road performance. As a reliable and practical choice for customers, it has improved ease of handling and comfort for on-road driving as well.",
            "Various powertrains to achieve powerful driving performance and environmental performance worthy of a Land Cruiser",
            "The 250 Series inherits the Land Cruiser mission of supporting the lives and livelihoods of people everywhere, while pursuing the reliability, durability, and off-road performance that is the DNA of the Land Cruiser. In line with Toyota's carbon neutrality initiatives that take a diverse multi-pathway approach, it also comes with various powertrains, including the first hybrid system for a Land Cruiser. These achieve powerful driving performance and environmental performance worthy of a Land Cruiser.",
            "Functional package carries people and cargo safely in every situation",
            "The 250 Series achieves good forward visibility through a low-set cowl and instrument panel top surface, which contribute to safe on- and off-road driving. It also employs a low beltline to improve visibility of road surfaces even on rough roads. While dramatically improving off-road driving performance on the traditional Land Cruiser wheelbase, this series has a shorter mirror-to-mirror width to ensure good maneuverability.",
            "With the durability of parts and easy repairs in the event of breakages, the design also takes customizability into account to allow users to enjoy their Land Cruiser in their own unique ways.",
            "Land Cruiser styling fuses traditional and modern",
            "In a fusion of traditional and modern, interior and exterior styling on the 250 Series focuses on three keywords: \"reliable\" (reliability to withstand harsh usage conditions), \"timeless\" (timeless simplicity to remain a favorite), and \"professional\" (refined functional beauty common to lean professional tools).",
            "Exterior styling employs horizontal lines to reproduce the unique Land Cruiser silhouette, while interior styling has shifted from a high-end, luxury ambiance to the feeling of true off-road functionality. Coupled with a sturdy and stable interior space, horizontal instrument panel, and switch shapes that are clear and easy to operate in a range of driving conditions, styling contributes to improved functionality even on rough roads.",
            "Latest Toyota Safety Sense package",
            "Toyota Safety Sense, the latest active safety package with advanced and improved functions, is standard on all new Land Cruiser grades. The range of detectable accidents has been expanded even further, enabling enjoyable driving with peace of mind."

        "segments": [
            "To mark the special anniversary of the iconic 911 sports car, the engineers in Weissach have designed a highly purist sports car dedicated to sheer driving enjoyment: the 911 S/T. The exclusive anniversary model unites the strengths of the 911 GT3 with Touring Package and the 911 GT3 RS and delivers a unique combination of agility and driving dynamics. It combines the naturally aspirated, 386 kW (525 PS) 4.0-litre boxer engine from the 911 GT3 RS with a short-ratio manual transmission. This is complemented by a resolutely lightweight construction and a running-gear setup optimised for agility and drivability. The Porsche 911 S/T weighs just 1,380 kilograms (DIN kerb weight, incl. all fluids), making it the lightest model of the 992 generation. The optional Heritage Design Package draws inspiration from the racing version of the 911 S from the late 1960s and early 1970s.",
            "The design of the anniversary model incorporated GT and motorsport expertise from Porsche. This is reflected in its particularly nimble and agile handling, which is designed for maximum driving enjoyment on winding country roads. The reduction of rotating mass both in the engine as well as the wheels and brakes ensures particularly dynamic responsiveness. The S/T responds to driver commands instantaneously. Every steering movement, every ounce of pressure on the accelerator or brake is implemented immediately and with pinpoint precision. Unlike the 911 GT3 RS, the focus of the development of the 911 S/T has been not on track use, but rather for journeys on public roads.",
            "The name marks out the new 911 S/T as the descendant of a particularly performance-focused version of the first 911 generation. From 1969, Porsche offered a special race version of the 911 S. Internally, these vehicles were called 911 ST. Modifications to the chassis, wheels, engine and body significantly improved acceleration, braking, traction and cornering grip. Large spoilers and other aerodynamic aids were not yet used in these models. The new 911 S/T takes up the spirit of the original 911 S (ST) and transfers it to the current model generation of the Porsche 911. The anniversary model combines elements of the 911 GT3 RS with the body of the 911 GT3 with Touring Package and supplements it with lightweight components specially developed for the 911 S/T. The result is a unique driving experience within the 911 GT portfolio.",
            "Lightweight construction from the wings to the clutch",
            "Among other measures, the Porsche 911 S/T achieves its particularly agile and direct handling through consistent lightweight design. The front bonnet, roof, front wings and the doors with their striking inlets are made of lightweight carbon-fibre-reinforced plastic (CFRP). The same applies to the roll cage, rear axle anti-roll bar and shear panel (stiffening element on the rear axle). Porsche also fits the anniversary model with magnesium wheels, the PCCB system, a lithium-ion starter battery and lightweight glass, all as standard. With reduced insulation, the omission of rear-axle steering and weight savings in the powertrain, the 911 S/T achieves a DIN kerb weight of just 1,380 kg. This makes the car, optimised for a fast-road setup, a further 40 kg lighter than a manual 911 GT3 Touring.",
            "Porsche engineers developed a new lightweight clutch exclusively for the 911 S/T. In conjunction with a single-mass flywheel, it reduces the weight of the rotating mass by 10.5 kg. This noticeably improves the responsiveness of the naturally aspirated boxer engine, which now builds revs with especially bracing speed and directness. Coupled with a six-speed manual transmission with a shorter gear ratio than on the 911 GT3, the high-revving engine in the 911 S/T delivers even more immediacy in its dynamics. It propels the 911 S/T to 100 km/h in just 3.7 seconds. It achieves a top speed of 300 km/h. The exhilarating driving experience is heightened by the compelling soundscape of the standard lightweight sports exhaust system. The 911 S/T is the only 911 of the current generation to combine a double-wishbone front-axle design with a multi-link rear axle without rear-axle steering. The dampers and control systems were tuned accordingly.",
            "The aerodynamics of the Porsche 911 S/T are also optimised for the public road rather than the racing track. The anniversary model is equipped as standard with a Gurney flap on the extending rear spoiler. Standard equipment also includes 20-inch (front) and 21-inch (rear) lightweight centre-locking magnesium wheels. Ultra-high-performance 255/35 ZR 20 tyres, meanwhile, ensure a high level of mechanical grip at the front of the car. On the rear, the 911 S/T features 315/30 ZR 21 tyres. CFRP full bucket seats come as standard. The four-way-adjustable Sports Seat Plus is available at no extra charge. The instrument cluster and the clock of the Sport Chrono package are finished in a classic green Porsche colour scheme.",
            "The Porsche 911 S/T is offered with an optional exclusive Heritage Design Package. The new exterior colour Shoreblue Metallic and the wheel rim colour Ceramica are exclusively available for this particularly elegant variant. On the doors, a starting number from 0 to 99 as well as a decorative foil can be applied on request. The classic-design Porsche crest from the original 911 that adorns the front, the hub caps, the steering wheel, the headrests and the car key underscores the historic roots of the 911 S/T. The interior also features cloth seat centers in Classic Cognac with black pinstripes, which are another homage to heritage. Two-tone semi-aniline leather trim in Black/Classic Cognac leather with extensive leather surrounds, a roof lining in perforated Dinamica, and other elements from Porsche Exclusive Manufaktur round out the package. The Porsche logo and the 911 S/T model designation on the rear of the car are in Gold.",
            "Porsche Design is exclusively offering customers of the 911 S/T the Chronograph 1 - 911 S/T. Featuring a titanium case, uncoated and blasted for weight-saving reasons, this exclusive timepiece goes all in on the lightweight design principle of the new purist 911 special edition. The heart of the chronograph is the Porsche Design WERK 01.240 with its COSC certification and flyback function. It is operated with a rotor in the design of the magnesium wheel of the 911 S/T.",
            "The new Porsche 911 S/T can be ordered for 292,187 euros including VAT. The Heritage Design Package costs 17,505 euros including VAT. The Chronograph 1 - 911 S/T is available for 11,950 euros."

The design study's elegant silhouette and dramatic proportions express Automobili Pininfarina's PURA design philosophy, effortlessly transforming the DNA of iconic models from Pininfarina SpA's past to define the future - envisioned here as a beautiful electric Luxury Utility Vehicle (e-LUV).",
            "The new design concept will inspire the next generation of Automobili Pininfarina's pure electric luxury vehicles and will make its public debut at Monterey Car Week in August, where it will appear alongside the recently-revealed Battista Edizione Nino Farina hyper GT and another new production vehicle of an equally exquisite, yet different proposition, itself defining a new genre of driving pleasure.",
            "PURA Vision represents a striking interpretation of an electric Luxury Utility Vehicle, with bold cab-rear proportions that combine timeless beauty with exquisite detailing to create a dynamic identity with unmistakable presence. Show-stopping features include its narrow glasshouse and tri-opening pillarless doors, which provide supreme access to its sophisticated cabin.",
            "Paolo Dellachà, Chief Executive Officer for Automobili Pininfarina, said: \"PURA Vision is the bridge from our present to an exciting new chapter in the history of Automobili Pininfarina. In our fifth year, we have already celebrated our unique heritage with the introduction of the Battista Edizione Nino Farina. PURA Vision previews an exciting future and shows what can be achieved if we apply our PURA design principles to an entirely new kind of vehicle. Much more important than simply a concept previewing one forthcoming vehicle, PURA Vision presents a sharp, modern design philosophy inspired by the rich heritage of Pininfarina and defining an unmistakable recipe for a collection of beautiful new luxury cars. The first of our new portfolio - spectacular to behold and a different proposition, yet clearly inspired by PURA Vision - will be presented alongside this wonderful design concept at Automobili Pininfarina's private residence during Monterey Car Week (17-20 August), as well as at The Quail - A Motorsports Gathering (18 August 2023).\"",
            "AUTOMOBILI PININFARINA PURA PHILOSOPHY",
            "Timeless design has been a hallmark of Pininfarina designs for 94 years and PURA Vision delivers trademark beauty through a mixture of classic proportions and exquisite detailing. It represents a unique sculptural statement with its low hood and high fenders inspired by the iconic 1947 Cisitalia - the first vehicle to enter the Museum of Modern Art's (MoMA) collection in New York.",
            "Dave Amantea, Chief Design Officer, Automobili Pininfarina, said: \"PURA Vision embraces the DNA of iconic vehicles from Pininfarina's past, to shape the future with sharp lines and a modern aesthetic. It is distinctive from every angle and showcases our PURA design philosophy on a new kind of vehicle. A dramatic presence, inviting interior and curated materials make this a car like no other, yet clients will recognise it as a Pininfarina with its beautiful body, timeless proportions and technical lower body detailing.\"",
            "EXTRAORDINARY EXTERIOR",
            "PURA Vision features a distinctive face, defined by hidden headlights and ultra-slim L.E.S.S. nanofibre lighting technology that creates a statement daytime running light signature. With fibres measuring less than 1mm thick, the advanced lighting technology can be tailored to suit almost any design, while its lightweight construction and superior energy efficiency is perfectly suited to a visionary electric LUV. The headlights are housed within a full-width multi-functional technical design element that defines the lower sections of body, and aids cooling and aerodynamic performance.",
            "The choice of exterior materials and colour finishes accentuates PURA Vision's athletic presence, with the sophisticated surfaces of the Bianco Sestriere Gloss body contrasting with the exposed carbon fibre lower elements, the narrow glasshouse and gloss black floating roof above. In profile, PURA Vision's dramatic cab-rear proportions and short overhangs provide a powerful stance, while 23-inch alloy wheels add to its purposeful presence. Its tyres feature a white stripe, unifying the exterior and adding definition to the matt black wheels.",
            "An innovative panoramic roof adds to the sense of sophisticated luxury. Its fixed 'biscotto' centre section is illuminated by a ring of gentle LED lighting and links the expansive windscreen at the front with the tailgate at the rear. The central 'biscotto' supports the large curved single-piece side windows, which form part of the Lounge Door openings on each side, while also ensuring PURA Vision is instantly recognisable from above. They hinge dramatically upwards and, in combination with the pillarless opening and rear-hinged back doors, provide unrestricted access to spacious 2+2 seating. The Lounge Doors were inspired by the pillarless design of the Lancia Florida saloon, which was penned by Battista Farina in the Fifties and was a favourite of Pininfarina's founder.",
            "Exterior jewellery showcases the attention to detail for which Automobili Pininfarina is renowned. These elements include a precisely engineered anodised aluminium beltline around the glasshouse, which begins at the windscreen and traces an elegant unbroken arc around PURA Vision. The roofline is defined by an aluminium element on each side. It incorporates the rear-facing cameras that replace conventional door mirrors, at the front, and bears the PURA Vision signature at the rear.",
            "The rear features ultra-slim horizontal LED lights and the glasshouse tapers in plan view, accentuating PURA Vision's crisply defined haunches, where the body rises sharply from the wheelarches - this vertical muscle has more in common with a sports car and contributes to PURA Vision's unique stance. In combination with the innovative biscotto roof, it creates a distinctive appearance when viewed from above - just like the Battista hyper GT.",
            "Lower down, the technical appearance of the exposed carbon fibre bumper echoes the front end, and contrasts with the pure surfaces and sculptural forms of the upper body.",
            "COMPELLING CONNECTIVITY & LUXURY",
            "On the outside, PURA Vision blends the road presence of an SUV with the purposeful character of a low-slung sports car, and its luxurious interior follows the same ethos. The driving position has more in common with a two-seater, yet the overall impression is of a light, airy and welcoming cabin. Its electric powertrain allows for generous cabin dimensions with a flat floor creating an expansive interior space - a sensation heightened by the panoramic glass roof.",
            "The world of luxury sailing yachts inspired the design of the sophisticated upper body on the exterior and this influence is also evident inside. PURA Vision's 'floating' front seats are suspended like the foil of a sailing craft, while the centre console resembles the boom of a sail. From behind the wheel, the expansive dashboard appears to merge with the exterior, extending the distinctive lines of the hood into the cabin.",
            "Francesco Cundari, Interior Design Director, Automobili Pininfarina, said: \"PURA Vision showcases a future generation of elegant Automobili Pininfarina interiors where clients are cocooned in tailored comfort, with elevated visibility and exquisite material choices. It combines the personality of a sports car with the space and comfort of a luxury vehicle.\"",
            "The next generation of Automobili Pininfarina vehicles promises to deliver connected convenience at every turn and PURA Vision reflects this ambition. Its technology-rich cabin has been designed to serve occupants with the information they need, when they need it, using an intuitive central touchscreen, advanced digital instrumentation and a head-up display, which can all be personalised by the driver.",
            "The attention to detail evident in the visual design is also showcased by the application of advanced technologies. The central display rises from the console when required but can be stowed to minimise distractions, while speakers in the headrests provide individual sound zones for each occupant, for a truly bespoke travelling experience. The large glass area ensures all passengers feel connected to their surroundings, enhancing every trip, and an integrated wine cooler between the pair of rear seats ensures occupants enjoy contemporary luxury in every sense.",
            "SUSTAINABLE INNOVATION",
            "The application of sophisticated, authentic and highly tactile materials is a hallmark of PURA Vision, contributing to a unique sense of crafted contemporary luxury inside. Each of the four individual seats features a crisp white finish, while charcoal leather on the dashboard and door tops provides a continuous 360-degree accent band around the interior.",
            "Soft semi-aniline leather mixes with a signature textile fabric throughout, while exposed carbon fibre and anodised aluminium echo the finishes applied to the exterior. As part of its production, Automobili Pininfarina used waste aluminium from PURA Vision's wheels to craft bespoke protective kickplates that adorn the door sills, adding to the wow effect when the tri-opening Lounge Doors open.",
            "Sara Campagnolo, Colour and Materials Design Director, Automobili Pininfarina, said: \"Materials are more than just a cover - they represent the very fabric of our vehicles. In keeping with our PURA design philosophy, PURA Vision uses the fewest and highest quality materials possible, as efficiently as possible, to create a highly tailored, timeless and sustainable finish.\"",
            "The new signature textile on the centre console, upper seatbacks and headlining combines 30% Nativa wool and 70% recycled polyester. Its melange herringbone pattern provides a tactile finish and features electro-welded Pininfarina logos on the seat headrests. Despite PURA Vision's status as a design concept, the innovative textile already meets Automobili Pininfarina durability standards for production vehicles.",

Both models offer a very high level of active and passive safety, courtesy of rigid bodies and a now even more advanced range of assistance systems. Being based on the same MQB-A0 platform, both the Scala and the Kamiq feature efficient, modern TSI engines from the evo2 generation, with power outputs ranging from 70 kW (95 hp) to 110 kW (150 hp). With its refined, sharply drawn lines, the Scala looks even more dynamic, while the Kamiq's design adjustments lend it more rugged SUV appeal. Both models now come with Škoda's TOP LED Matrix headlights as an option - a first for these models. An increased proportion of recycled and natural materials for the exterior and interior ensures greater sustainability. The restructured product range for both models now consists of three trim levels with six interior variants along with optional equipment packages. A Digital Display with an 8-inch screen diagonal and an 8.25-inch Škoda Infotainment display already come as standard in all models. New Simply Clever details round off the refresh.",
            "With its Scala and Kamiq models, Škoda Auto has successfully won over new customers for the brand. An expressively designed, practical hatchback model with comprehensive standard equipment, the Scala has set benchmarks in the compact class with its generous interior space and luggage capacity. Since first appearing in showrooms in 2019, nearly 230,000 units have been delivered to customers in 57 markets worldwide. A few months after presenting the Scala, the Czech car manufacturer entered the booming city SUV segment with the new Kamiq. This model offers the advantages of an SUV such as a better view and more comfortable entry and exit courtesy of its raised seating position, along with greater ground clearance, and combines these features with the agility and handling of a compact car. As the third model in the Czech brand's current SUV campaign, it quickly became a bestseller. More than 351,000 Kamiqs have rolled off the production line so far, making it the best-selling Škoda SUV in both 2021 and 2022, ahead of its popular big brothers, the Kodiaq and Karoq. The Kamiq has been delivered to customers in 60 markets worldwide.",
            "A breath of fresh air with a new design and, for the first time, TOP LED Matrix headlights",
            "Škoda has now presented the Scala and Kamiq with extensive updates. The Scala now looks even more dynamic, evoking the Vision RS concept study with its revised Škoda grille, slimmed-down headlights, redesigned aprons at the front and rear and striking air curtains. The Kamiq now comes with a larger, more upright Škoda grille, while new aprons with striking diffusers lend it more rugged SUV appeal. Moreover, the Kamiq's signature split headlights have new proportions: the upper lighting element is even more slender, while the lower one has grown in size. It accommodates optional TOP LED Matrix headlights with distinctive hexagonal Matrix modules, available for the first time for the Kamiq as well as the Scala. In the hatchback model, the crystalline LED modules were designed to evoke sparkling little blocks of ice or gemstones.",
            "Sustainable materials and efficient powertrains",
            "Škoda has again increased the proportion of sustainable materials in the Scala and Kamiq produced at the main plant in Mladá Boleslav. For example, the water reservoir underneath the windscreen and the wheel arch linings are made from recycled plastics. In the interior, natural plant fibres from hemp and kenaf are used in the door trim panels and in the structure of the roof lining, alongside recycled fabrics for the upholstery, flooring and foot mats. The engine range comprises three modern TSI units from the highly efficient evo2 generation. The entry-level engine is a 1.0 TSI three-cylinder unit with 70 kW (95 hp) and manual 5-speed transmission. The 1.0 TSI with 85 kW (115 hp) is available with a manual 6-speed gearbox or a 7-speed DSG. The same applies to the top engine, the 110 kW (150 hp) four-cylinder 1.5 TSI. It has ACT cylinder deactivation, which automatically switches off the two middle cylinders when their power is not needed. This is practically imperceptible to the driver and reduces fuel consumption. In addition to the standard suspension, a rough road suspension (with 15 millimetres more ground clearance for the Scala) and Sport Chassis Control with a choice of two damper settings (lowered by 15 millimetres for the Scala and by 10 millimetres for the Kamiq) are optionally available for both models.",
            "Safety: Upgraded range of features for further improved active and passive safety",
            "As is typical for Škoda, the upgraded Kamiq and Scala come with numerous assistance systems, some of which are more commonly associated with higher vehicle categories. They thus further enhance the level of active and passive safety of these two compact models: in the European Union, the standard equipment includes, for example, Front Assist with Pedestrian Monitor, Lane Assist and Traffic Sign Recognition among other features. In the event of an accident, up to nine airbags protect the occupants.",
            "Restructured product range with three trim levels and six interior variants",

In addition, there are optional equipment packages in several categories, as well as a number of individual options. The popular Monte Carlo variants, which are an homage to Škoda's successes in the Monte Carlo Rally, traditionally stand out with their black accents as well as man-made Carbon leather in the interior. A Digital Display with an 8-inch screen diagonal and an 8.25-inch Škoda Infotainment display already come as standard in all models.

Since first appearing in showrooms in 2019, nearly 230,000 units have been delivered to customers in 57 markets worldwide. A few months after presenting the Scala, the Czech car manufacturer entered the booming city SUV segment with the new Kamiq. This model offers the advantages of an SUV such as a better view and more comfortable entry and exit courtesy of its raised seating position, along with greater ground clearance, and combines these features with the agility and handling of a compact car. As the third model in the Czech brand's current SUV campaign, it quickly became a bestseller. More than 351,000 Kamiqs have rolled off the production line so far, making it the best-selling Škoda SUV in both 2021 and 2022, ahead of its popular big brothers, the Kodiaq and Karoq.

For example, the water reservoir underneath the windscreen and the wheel arch linings are made from recycled plastics. In the interior, natural plant fibres from hemp and kenaf are used in the door trim panels and in the structure of the roof lining, alongside recycled fabrics for the upholstery, flooring and foot mats. The engine range comprises three modern TSI units from the highly efficient evo2 generation. The entry-level engine is a 1.0 TSI three-cylinder unit with 70 kW (95 hp) and manual 5-speed transmission. The 1.0 TSI with 85 kW (115 hp) is available with a manual 6-speed gearbox or a 7-speed DSG. The same applies to the top engine, the 110 kW (150 hp) four-cylinder 1.5 TSI. It has ACT cylinder deactivation, which automatically switches off the two middle cylinders when their power is not needed. This is practically imperceptible to the driver and reduces fuel consumption. In addition to the standard suspension, a rough road suspension (with 15 millimetres more ground clearance for the Scala) and Sport Chassis Control with a choice of two damper settings (lowered by 15 millimetres for the Scala and by 10 millimetres for the Kamiq) are optionally available for both models.",

            "The front of Z NISMO prominently features a styling element called the \"Grand-Nose\" or \"G-Nose,\" which extends farther forward than on other grades and recalls a similar design treatment on the heritage Nissan Fairlady 240ZG.",
            "The new front fascia also features a restyled grille opening with the thinnest honeycomb mesh of any Nissan production car. That mesh grille balances the need to reduce drag with permitting cooling air to the engine bay. Canards at the car's front corners create vortexes over the front wheels, further benefiting aerodynamic performance. A subtle red accent runs along the lower edge of the front fascia.",
            "Complementing the G-Nose is a taller, wider rear spoiler (compared to Z Performance) with a three-piece design that extends onto the rear fenders. The rear bumper corners are reshaped to aid with air separation and reduced drag; their shape is inspired by that on GT-R NISMO. A red accent runs from the lower edges of the rear fascia and above the exhaust outlets. Z NISMO's redesigned side sills also help reduce aerodynamic drag and lift.",
            "Above the window line, Z NISMO further stands apart from other grades with a dark metallic gray version of the car's signature katana-blade styling element. Additionally, it has a black-painted roof and gloss black 19-inch RAYS® wheels.",
            "Z NISMO's bodywork is available in a choice of five colors: Black Diamond Pearl, Brilliant Silver, Passion Red TriCoat, Everest White Pearl TriCoat and NISMO-exclusive Stealth Grey.",

            "Nissan Z NISMO exclusively uses a nine-speed automatic transmission that has been enhanced for faster and more dynamic shifting performance, with a particular focus on suitability for track use. Compared to the transmission in other Z grades, it has revised clutch packs allowing for faster shifting. Along with revised engine management software, Z NISMO's transmission has reduced downshift time by almost half, compared to Z Performance. Launch control also delivers more aggressive standing-start acceleration.",
            "In addition to Normal and Sport, Z NISMO adds a new Sport+ drive mode. This delivers a more dynamic, racetrack-tuned shift program for circuit driving, taking advantage of the powertrain's faster downshift capability. The shift programming is designed to be so responsive for performance driving that a driver does not need to use the shift paddles on track - though fast-responding manual shifting is always available.",
            "Enhanced suspension and tires",
            "NISMO engineers revised every element of the car's suspension to optimize precision, predictability and cornering grip. Z NISMO has unique stabilizer bars, a stiffer spring rate and larger, retuned dampers. The overarching tuning ethos was to deliver accurate, \"one-shot\" steering that helps drivers to pick their line through a turn with a minimum of steering adjustment needed, contributing to confident track-ready performance.",
            "To deliver maximum road feel and traction, Z NISMO wears Dunlop® SP SPORT MAXX GT600 tires, a version of which are also used on GT-R. The rear tires measure 10 millimeters wider than those equipped on Z Performance (285/35R19 versus 275/35R19).",
            "The tires are fitted to lightweight, NISMO-specific, gloss black RAYS 19-inch wheels. Although the wheels are 0.5 inch wider than the 19-inch wheels on Z Performance (10 inches wide front, 10.5 inches wide rear), their advanced construction means the NISMO-specific wheels are slightly lighter.",
            "Stiffened chassis",
            "Comprehensive chassis revisions to Z NISMO begin with bracing and stiffening measures that help the car faithfully track and respond to the increased cornering forces enabled by Z NISMO's tires. Enhancements include additional front, rear and rear underfloor bracing, helping increase torsional rigidity by 2.5% compared to the standard grades. Stiffer front and rear suspension bushings, and a stiffer mounting bushing for the steering rack, further increase lateral rigidity.",
            "Track-enhanced brake system",
            "Engineers enhanced the Z NISMO braking system, upgrading the front brakes to larger, 15.0-inch rotors matched to 13.8-inch rear brake rotors, and equipping a more performance-focused brake pad compound. The changes are intended to improve Z's impressive brake pedal feel and enhance braking performance in extended track use scenarios.",

            "This functionality allows the user to select the maximum current for AC charging to prevent it tripping the breaker in locations where a dedicated power breaker for AC chargers is not used.",
            "Powertrain and chassis engineered to deliver dynamic performance, with exceptional comfort and quietness",
            "The Honda e:Ny1's chassis and powertrain have been engineered to deliver a fun and confidence-inspiring driving experience that combines Honda's spirit of performance and the benefits of electric propulsion. Key to this is the first European application of Honda's e:N Architecture F high-performance platform.",
            "A part of the brand's global electrification strategy, the e:N Architecture is a modular approach to electric vehicle (EV) design. The fundamental ideology behind it is that the common modular components are supported by an appropriate, high-rigidity core body structure for highly dynamic performance. In the e:Ny1, the 'F' designation of the architecture stands for front-motor, front-wheel drive and will underpin small to medium sized Honda EVs going forward.",
            "Other platforms within the global portfolio will also be offered with all-, and rear-wheel drive options, all built around the same principles of a central, high-density, high-efficiency battery paired with a compact high-power drive motor, or motors for AWD applications.",
            "For application on the F platform, the cleverly packaged three-in-one motor, which houses the power drive unit, electric motor and transmission, has a combined weight of just 77.4kg (with oil) over the front axle. The high performance 150 kW motor boasts exceptional 92% efficiency, delivering up to 310 Nm of torque (2,788 Nm at the wheels), propelling the car from standstill to 100 km/h in 7.6 seconds and to a maximum speed of 160 km/h. Advanced thermal management is achieved through a water-cooled circuit, which ensures consistent power delivery without overheating.",
            "This dynamic set up underpins a lightweight yet rigid body frame that is constructed from a blend of high-tensile steels with 47% (by weight) of the model's body made of these materials. Their strategic application around the vehicle has resulted in high torsional rigidity and low mass, with the e:Ny1 over 100kg lighter than some European rivals.",
            "When compared to the HR-V, the Honda e:Ny1 features additional high-tensile bracing to the floor and roof sections, as well as around the front wheel wells, providing a more solid base from which to build a dynamic electric vehicle.",
            "Impressive battery performance with charging flexibility and consistency",
            "The compact 68.8 kWh lithium-ion battery, located under the floor of the e:Ny1, provides a range of up to 412 km (WLTP), with its fast-charging capability allowing it to charge from 10% to 80% in approximately 45 minutes using a DC rapid charger and CCS connector. This method also allows 100km of range to be added in just 11 minutes. When using a standard domestic AC charger, 10-80% of total charging capacity can be achieved in six hours.",
            "With integrated water-cooling, the high-density battery consists of 195Ah cells, located in the centre of the e:Ny1 underfloor. This layout contributes to a low centre of gravity and concentrated mass for improved road holding, as well as to overall aerodynamic performance without the need for additional external parts.",
            "While battery capacity is similar to class leaders, Honda's latest EV stands out from its competitors for its higher rate of charging consistency as, while some competitors offer a greater maximum rate of charge, this level is rarely achieved due to fluctuations in charging rates at different stages of the battery charging cycle.",
            "The Honda e:Ny1 has a specifically developed recharging system that permits a sustained higher charge rate over its rivals. Whilst some manufacturers have prioritised headline rapid charge figures, the e:Ny1 is able to maintain a higher average rate for more of the charging process. The linear, higher charge rate is maintained for well over half of the charge, with very little drop off towards full capacity.",
            "This approach is beneficial to customers as it helps prevent premature battery deterioration and helps maintain range over the vehicle's lifespan. Charge power and charging strategy are two fundamental elements that significantly influence battery life span. Honda's approach to this has therefore been to create a healthy balance between user practicality and battery durability via sophisticated energy management and thermal control systems.",
            "Dynamic handling defined by Honda's performance spirit",
            "The e:Ny1 development team set out to create a refined, smooth ride to maximise passenger comfort and interior quietness, while also offering a fun, agile driving experience. The goal was to create a fully electric SUV that is dynamically optimised for all European use cases and a broad range of road surfaces, with engaging handling and sure-footed stability that would inspire confidence among customers switching from combustion-engine vehicles.",
            "Honda's dynamic stability control ensures steering feel is smooth and linear, providing enough feedback to allow drivers to sense the available traction and adapt their inputs accordingly. Steering is light and agile at low speeds, with a firmer feel when travelling faster - a development specifically for the European version of e:Ny1.",
            "For the benefit of occupants and to minimise motion sickness, Honda's newest electric model is engineered to deliver smooth and comfortable acceleration and deceleration, without diminishing the appeal of the powerful and responsive acceleration typical of EVs.",
            "The relaxing interior ambience is maintained on the move thanks in part to a major focus on reducing cabin noise intrusion to levels achieved by vehicles in the class above. Road noise in the low- to mid-range frequencies is significantly reduced thanks to Honda's unique resonator wheel application, an additional dynamic damper on the H-beam, and the low sub-frame weight. These are complemented by strategically placed cabin insulation that reduces high frequency noise and vibration.",
            "Three dedicated pre-set driving modes, Sport, Normal and Econ Drive, enable drivers to manually adjust the car's performance settings to balance driving characteristics and efficiency. Econ mode reduces throttle response, prioritising energy conservation by adjusting the air conditioning, heated seats, and heated steering wheel to maintain the driver's perceived temperature for a more economical drive. In contrast, Sport mode delivers a more exhilarating experience with highly responsive acceleration, while normal mode provides an optimal balance of performance and full cabin comfort.",
            "Advanced passive and active safety technology provides exceptional protection and driver support",
            "The e:Ny1 becomes the latest model to feature the Honda SENSING suite of active safety technologies as standard, employing the brand's latest camera and sonar technology.",

Another camera is positioned at the rear of the vehicle, and one on each door mirror, resulting in 360-degree coverage for Advance grades.",
            "Supporting the camera-based system are twelve sonar sensors located around the car - four on each of the front and rear bumpers, and two on either side - which can detect objects such as buildings and other vehicles with a high level of accuracy. The camera and sonar systems work in unison to improve overall safety, allowing the e:Ny1 to accurately identify road markings and verges with no lines, as well as motorcycles, cyclists and other vehicles.",
            "A combination of soft and rigid structural components, including high tensile strength steel, form part of a strong body that provides exceptional front, rear and side collision protection by dissipating energy away from the cabin in the unfortunate event of an accident. This crash safety protection strategy also maximises safety for high-voltage electrical components, which are automatically shut down in the event of a collision.",
            "Honda SENSING features",
            "Honda SENSING is among the industry's most comprehensive safety technology packages. It uses a combination of data from the various camera, radar and sonar sensors to warn and assist the driver in potentially dangerous scenarios.",
            "Honda's Road Departure Mitigation System alerts drivers when lane drift is detected without a turn signal in use. Using the Lane Keeping Assist System, the vehicle can automatically apply mild steering torque to assist the driver in maintaining proper lane position and/or apply the brakes to slow the e:Ny1's departure from a detected lane.",
            "The vehicle is also equipped with the latest Traffic Jam Assist technology. This reduces the driver's workload in low-speed traffic by helping to keep the vehicle in its lane, starting from 0 km/h. When congestion clears, the car seamlessly switches to the Lane Keeping Assist System from 60 km/h, a lower speed than conventional systems.",
            "In addition, the Traffic Sign Recognition System recognises road signs and displays them on the instrument binnacle. The system also provides a pre-notification of signs to help the driver prepare for junctions or upcoming changes in the speed limit, while also working with the Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC), using one-touch speed adjustment, to match the prevailing speed limit.",
            "The Driver Attention Monitor alerts drivers when it detects that their attention to the road is diminished. The system uses an angle sensor to measure the degree of steering-wheel corrections by the driver in maintaining a proper lane position. If it senses unusual and constant correction activity, the system will notify the driver to take a break."

There are two versions of the standard specification - one with an engine that has a maximum output of 135 kW and a maximum torque of 430 Nm, and one with an engine that has a maximum output of 110 kW and a maximum torque of 330 Nm. Both have a variable geometry turbo charger that performs variable control of turbine capacity.",
            "The all-new Triton comes with either a six-speed automatic transmission with the highly acclaimed Sports mode from the previous model, or a six-speed manual transmission with shift-by-wire that reduces vibration directly transmitted from the engine and improving comfort.",
            "Improved road performance by newly developed suspension and a mature 4WD system",
            "The 4WD system enables the driver to easily shift to 4WD mode while driving by using a dial selector. The all-new Triton continues to use Mitsubishi Motors' Super Select 4WD-II and Easy Select 4WD systems, and Super Select 4WD-II is equipped with a center torque sensing Limited Slip Differential (LSD) that distributes driving force at a ratio of 40% to the front and 60% to the rear, thus ensuring both traction performance and cornering performance.",
            "Models equipped with the Super Select 4WD-II system can select from the four options of 2H (rear-wheel drive), 4H (full-time four-wheel drive), 4HLc (locked center differential) and 4LLc (locked center differential with lower gears), and have seven drive modes including on-road modes, an increase over the four off-road modes of the previous model. Along with Normal mode that is available in all four-wheel drive modes, 2H offers Eco mode for prioritization of economy, 4H offers Gravel and Snow modes, 4HLc offers Mud and Sand modes for traction performance, while 4LLc provides Rock mode, allowing drivers to select the optimum drive mode for any road condition. The 4WD modes available for selection in vehicles equipped with Easy Select 4WD are 2H (rear-wheel drive), 4H (locked center differential), and 4L (for low-gear driving).",
            "AYC is newly adopted for models equipped with the Super Select 4WD-II system. It improves cornering performance by applying light braking to the inside front wheel when cornering. Both the two-wheel and four-wheel drive models are equipped with active LSD (brake control type). By applying the brake to a spinning wheel and distributing the driving torque to wheels gripping the road surface, it improves safety on slippery surfaces while also providing a sporty driving experience.",
            "Active Stability & Traction Control (ASTC) that improves stability on winding roads is standard equipped on all models. Other systems include Hill Descent Control (HDC), which maintains a set speed on downhill slopes to enable driving with confidence, and Hill Start Assist (HSA), which prevents roll-back in hill starts.",
            "The newly developed suspension retains a double wishbone structure for the front suspension, and prioritizes reliability and durability. The upper suspension mounting arm has been moved higher to increase the stroke by 20mm, providing improved road-holding and ride comfort. The rear suspension provides greater ride comfort while retaining its strength and uses a lighter leaf spring system together with thicker shock absorbers.",
            "While beefing-up the body size, the increase in turning radius has been minimized, and driving has been made easier by using a hood shape that lets the driver see the hood line. For the high-output engine model, an electric power steering is adopted, which enables better control by providing more assistance in the low-speed range, while it increases feedback in the high-speed range to provide peace of mind for the driver. It also takes safety and comfort into account through its reduction of kickback from the road surface and tuning for off-road driving or towing.",
            "Beast Mode design concept",
            "The all-new Triton combines agility with the Mitsubishi Motors' robust design to create an imposing look while expressing the toughness and powerfulness expected of a pickup truck.",
            "The front face design concept of Dynamic Shield that expresses powerful performance and the peace of mind protecting both the people and the car is optimized for a pickup truck through a powerful form based on a robust, three-dimensional front grille and fenders, and a protector that emphasizes this form. The daytime running lights featuring three L-shaped LED lights resemble a sharp gaze of a hawk, and in combination with the three-dimensional 3-light headlights below them, the design gives the all-new Mitsubishi Triton an overwhelming presence.",
            "The horizontally-themed body sides are composed of large, solid surfaces that emphasize the robust doors, while contrasting with the sharply overhanging fender panels to tighten them and make them appear wider, emphasizing stability and toughness.",
            "While ensuring the cargo bed is of an ample size, the solid surfaces continue along the side of the body up to the rear end. T-shaped tail lights on both sides emphasize width while also robustly displaying the sturdy rear design.",
            "Functional design has been incorporated in all aspects to drastically increase utility, including a cabin shape and rear spoiler that improve aerodynamics, more durable door handles that are now bigger and easier to grip, and wider side steps with improved water drainage.",
            "The instrument panel is designed with the Horizontal Axis concept, which uses horizontally-themed and strong shapes to allow drivers to easily see changes in the posture of the vehicle when driving. With a nod to professional use, soft pads have been incorporated in the main areas that protect passengers to ensure utility. In terms of design, the interior uses many geometric shapes and metallic elements to create a high-contrast, modern space.",
            "Particular attention has been paid to visibility for the monitor, meters, and switches that make use of contrast, and the selectors, dials, and switches all have the optimum level of sensitivity to allow them to be operated while wearing gloves. The steering wheel, grips, and door handles have all been designed based on an approach called Mitsubishi Touch, with a focus on grip comfort and sturdiness.",
            "The 6A/T and 6M/T center console has a cup holder that can accommodate two large cups, and the console box can hold four 600 mL plastic bottles. Taking professional use into account, the console box in the 5A/T model is capable of holding tablets and files in addition to being a cup holder. The glove box, smartphone holder, and other storage for small items are of an ample size that enables easy use even when wearing gloves, and the instrument panel and center console have USB A and C sockets for charging devices, as well as a wireless charger at the bottom of the center part of the instrument panel.",
            "Newly rolled out body colors are the vivid and metallic Yamabuki Orange Metallic and the Blade Silver Metallic that offers increased brilliance. The lineup also includes the high-quality basic colors - White Diamond, Solid White, Graphite Gray Metallic, and Jet Black Mica.",
            "With the highest trim level, the front grill is the same color as the body, while the door mirrors, Dynamic Shield garnish, plated components including the door handles, bumper, and other parts are black, and the underside of the front, sides, and rear is dark titanium. A styling bar on the black roof rails, over fenders, and cargo bed brings a sharper look. The use of black as the base color for the metallic embellishments in the interior brings sleekness, while orange accents bring a sense of class and sharpness.",
            "Improved basic performance as a pickup truck",
            "The cargo bed height has been lowered by 45 mm to 820 mm compared to the previous model, and the upper surface area of the bumper corner has been enlarged and reinforced with a frame to be used as a foot space, thereby improving practicality.",
            "The front seats provide firm lower back support while the shoulder areas provide ease of movement with an open shape, which helps to reduce driver fatigue. The hip point has also been moved 20 mm up compared to the previous model and an upright posture has been adopted to improve visibility from inside the vehicle. In addition, ingress and egress have been made easier by designing the A-pillar to be more vertical to widen the door openings and widening the side steps while making them a shape that reduces the risk of slipping.",
            "The all-new Mitsubishi Triton now comes equipped with Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) that tracks acceleration, deceleration, and stopping of the vehicle in front, and cruises while maintaining a preset distance between vehicles. Advanced safety features have been enhanced along with the retention of Forward Collision Mitigation system (FCM), Blind Spot Warning (BSW) with Lane Change Assist (LCA), and Rear Cross Traffic Alert (RCTA) among others.",
            "Mitsubishi Connect makes the experience of owning and driving a car more comfortable and enjoyable. For driver safety, a request for help can be made to a call center with the touch of a single button in the event of an accident or breakdown, while also being capable of automatically reporting the deployment of an airbag. By linking with a smartphone, Mitsubishi Connect enables a car finder function that displays the location of a parked car. Users can also check the remaining fuel volume and oil state, drive history, and other aspects of the vehicle's state. Furthermore, remote operations let users switch on the air conditioning before they get in the car, and also operate the headlights and horn. Smartphone linking uses the cellular network, so users can receive information from their car even if they are far away, provided they are in an area with cellular coverage.",
            "To improve maintainability, the location of the drain bolt has been changed to enable engine oil to be replaced without having to remove and replace the under-cover, and for 4WD/2WD High Riders, service hole size has been increased to enable garage jacks to be used without an attachment. And with gear oil replacement being unnecessary in the six-speed manual transmission model among other improvements, maintenance is becoming increasingly unneeded.",
            "A wide range of accessories are available, from protectors to dress-up accessories. The sport bar, fender arch moldings, and side door garnishes emphasize the solid image, and the grille emblems tighten the look. A bed liner, which is indispensable for pickup trucks, is also available."

            "For over 75 years, the E-Class has set the standard for mid-range luxury saloons. In 2023, Mercedes-Benz will open a new chapter for the business saloon: the new E-Class points the way in the transition from the combustion engine to electric drive. At the same time, its new electronics architecture allows a comprehensive digital user experience. The first saloon models of the 214 series will arrive at the European sales partners in autumn 2023.",
            "Classic proportions and special character lines in the exterior design",
            "The new Mercedes-Benz E-Class has the proportions of a classic three-box saloon: the short front overhang and long bonnet are followed by a greenhouse which is set well back. The \"cab-backward\" design is rounded off by the well-proportioned rear overhang.",
            "A black panel-like surface connects the radiator grille with the headlamps. This insert in high-gloss black is visually reminiscent of the Mercedes-EQ models. The three-dimensionally designed radiator grille is either progressive or classic, depending on the equipment line. The new E-Class has high-performance LED headlamps as standard. As an optional extra, DIGITAL LIGHT is available without and with a projection function. All headlamp variants offer a distinctive day and night design. As a typical feature of the brand, the daytime running lights take the shape of an eyebrow. Powerdomes accentuate the bonnet.",
            "The side view shows off the harmonious proportions and the distinctive \"cab-backward\" design to particularly good effect. The flush-fitting door handles familiar from the luxury Mercedes-Benz models are available as an option. The two separate character lines on the side emphasise the car's sporty character.",
            "Highlights at the rear include the two-section LED lights with a new contour and special design: the star motif in both light units provides a special day and night design.",
            "MBUX Superscreen as a highlight of the interior design",
            "The dashboard makes for the digital experience in the interior. If the E-Class is equipped with the optional front passenger screen, the large glass surface of the MBUX Superscreen extends to the central display. Visually detached from this is the driver's display in the driver's field of vision. The models without a passenger display feature a large trim element that extends to the centre. Visually detached, the central display appears to float above the concave surface of this trim element.",
            "The front section of the instrument panel is illuminated by the light strip of the Active Ambient Lighting. This runs in a wide arc from the windscreen, past the A-pillars and into the doors. This creates a generous feeling of space. An apparently free-floating control array in the upper section of the door panels matches the look of the glass surfaces of the screens.",
            "The centre console is designed as a homogeneous unit and merges in a straight line into the lower section of the dashboard. At the front, a stowage compartment with lid and cup holders is integrated into the three-dimensionally shaped trim element. There is a soft padded armrest in the rear part of the centre console.",
            "The door centre panel merges seamlessly into the armrest with a concave sweep. The front section here is designed as a metallic high-tech element. It serves as a grab and closing handle, and incorporates the switches for the power windows. Another highlight is the free-floating control array incorporating the door opener and the controls for the seat functions.",
            "The contours of the seat surface and backrest flow elegantly from the inside to the outside, and appear to float above the base of the seat thanks to their layer design. Indented vertical lines follow the outer contour, widening out towards the top.",
            "When it comes to spaciousness, the Mercedes-Benz E-Class is one of the favourites in its segment. The driver enjoys five millimetres more headroom than in the preceding model. The rear passengers particularly benefit from the two centimetre longer wheelbase: Kneeroom and maximum legroom are increased by 10 and 17 millimetres, respectively. The increase in elbow width in the rear is even greater: it is now 1519 millimetres. This is an increase by 25 millimetres, and almost S-class level. The luggage capacity is up to 540 litres.",
            "Half of the engine variants are plug-in hybrids",
            "Thanks to systematic electrification and intelligent downsizing, the new E-Class sets new standards in efficiency. Half of all the models will be fourth-generation plug-in hybrids. The model range already achieves this high proportion at market launch. Three of the six E-Class versions combine the advantages of a vehicle with combustion engine with those of an electric car.",
            "The combustion engines are four and six-cylinder units from the current modular Mercedes-Benz engine family FAME (Family of Modular Engines). Accordingly, the engine range plays a major role in the flexibility of the international production network, with needs-based electrification.",
            "In addition to turbocharging, both the diesel and petrol engines feature intelligent support from an integrated starter-generator (ISG). They are therefore mild hybrids. Thanks to a new battery, the power of the electric motor has been increased from 15 to 17 kW and the boost torque to 205 Nm.",
            "Mercedes-Benz will offer no less than three fourth-generation plug-in hybrid models from the market launch of the new E-Class.",
            "With an electric output of 95 kW (129 hp) and an all-electric range of up to over 100 kilometres (WLTP), they will in many cases and on many days be on the road purely electrically, without the use of the combustion engine. More plug-in hybrids with diesel combustion engines will follow.",
            "AIRMATIC and rear-axle steering are optionally available",
            "The agile handling of the new E-Class is due in large part to precise guidance of the front wheels by four control arms each. At the rear axle, an optimised multi-link independent rear suspension with five links ensures excellent wheel control and excellent straight-line stability. At both axles, the springs and dampers are combined in a single strut and are not involved in wheel guidance tasks, therefore the suspension responds with corresponding sensitivity. The front subframe and rear axle carrier decouple the suspension and body from vibrations and noise. As standard, the mild hybrid models are equipped with an AGILITY CONTROL steel spring suspension with selective damping system. It is also 15 millimetres lower than the suspension of the plug-in hybrids.",
            "The new Mercedes-Benz E-Class is available with the Technology package as an option. This includes the all-round AIRMATIC air suspension system with ADS+ continuously adjustable damping and rear-axle steering. The AIRMATIC suspension with air springs and adaptive ADS+ dampers responds very sensitively. Level control is another feature of AIRMATIC. It keeps the ground clearance constant irrespective of the vehicle load, but also makes changes when needed.",
            "The new E-Class is especially agile and stable with the optional rear-axle steering and the accompanying, more direct steering ratio at the front axle. The steering angle at the rear axle is 4.5 degrees. This reduces the turning circle by up to 90 centimetres",
            "Impressive, immersive entertainment experience",
            "Music, games and streaming content can be experienced with almost all the senses in the E-Class. Thanks to digital innovations in the interior, the E-Class is now more intelligent, achieving a new dimension of personalisation and interaction. At the same time, the electronic architecture is more software-driven and less hardware-driven.",
            "The computing functions of previously separate domains take place in a single processor. Screens and the MBUX infotainment system thus share a new, very powerful central onboard computer. This form of networking improves the performance and speed of the data streams.",
            "The Entertainment package (MBUX Entertainment Plus) will be available for the new E-Class. It includes Mercedes me connect services and a data package from a third-party provider. Depending on the market, a communication module with 5G as the transmission technology is used. The mobile phone standard 5G makes much faster data rates possible than LTE/UMTS.",
            "The Digital Vehicle Key is now available for the iPhone and Apple® Watch",
            "With the Digital Vehicle Key, the E-Class can be started and locked simply by the driver carrying a compatible device with them. Key sharing is also possible: various digital channels can be used to invite family members or friends to use the E-Class. In doing so, the vehicle owner can assign different rights, granting only access to the vehicle or also allowing it to be driven. The vehicle can recognise several users at once, and the Digital Vehicle Key can be shared by up to 16 persons. In those markets where Mercedes me connect services are available, the pre-installation for the Digital Vehicle Key forms part of the KEYLESS-GO Convenience Package. This equipment combination is available in the new Mercedes-Benz E-Class from the Premium Package onwards.",
            "Music becomes visible: Sound Visualisation",
            "With the new Active Ambient Lighting with Sound Visualisation, occupants in the new E-Class can experience music with three senses: pieces of music and sounds from films or apps can be heard (with Dolby Atmos® technology if desired), felt (by means of sound resonating transducers in the optional Burmester® 4D surround sound system) and now also \"seen\". Visualisation takes place on the light strip of the Active Ambient Lighting (optional extra). For the first time, this applies throughout in the E-Class. For example, fast sequences of beats can cause rapid light changes, while flowing rhythms can create softly merging lighting moods.",
            "The entertainment experience for the front passenger is always impressive. On their optional screen, the front passenger can watch dynamic content such as TV or video streaming even when the driver at the wheel is looking over at them. This is because the display is switchable. The advanced camera-based privacy function reduces its brightness and therefore the risk of driver distraction.",
            "New third-party apps plus selfie and video camera",
            "The software experts at Mercedes-Benz have developed a new compatibility layer that allows the installation of third-party apps. The following apps are available on the central display on the launch of the E-Class: the entertainment platform \"TikTok\", the game \"Angry Birds\", the collaborative application \"Webex\" and the office application \"Zoom\", as well as the browser \"Vivaldi\". In addition, the ZYNC entertainment portal (optionally) offers video streaming, on-demand content, interactive experiences, local video programmes, sports, news, games and much more on the central and passenger displays, via one user interface.",
            "Another new feature is a selfie and video camera (part of the optional MBUX Superscreen) on top of the dashboard. When the vehicle is stationary, the driver can participate in online video conferences via e.g. \"Webex\", and take personal photos and videos.",
            "More operating convenience is also available with MBUX. With the \"Just Talk\" function, the intelligent voice control can now be activated without the keyword \"Hey Mercedes\". When the function is activated, a red microphone symbol appears in the display. This indicates that the vehicle is ready and waiting for commands.",
            "Added day-to-day convenience: the routines",
            "Mercedes-Benz is working on the use of artificial intelligence (AI) so that the car learns which comfort systems vehicle occupants use repeatedly. Given the same circumstances, the aim is for AI to automate such functions. The result is personalised automation. Mercedes-Benz uses the term 'routine' for this innovation, the development of which is already well advanced.",
            "On the launch of the new Mercedes-Benz E-Class, customers will be able to use templates for standard routines. They also have the option of creating routines themselves. In doing so, the occupants can link several functions and conditions. For example, \"Switch on the seat heating and set the ambient lighting to warm orange if the interior temperature is below twelve degrees Celsius\".",
            "For enhanced well-being: ENERGIZING COMFORT and THERMOTRONIC with Digital Vent Control (both optional)",
            "Soothing sounds, mobilising massage, activating light - Mercedes-Benz offers a comprehensive wellness programme with the variously configured ENERGIZING COMFORT programmes and the individual recommendations of the ENERGIZING COACH. The E-Class marks the debut of a new feature: The anti-travel sickness program of ENERGIZING COMFORT can help affected passengers to alleviate the symptoms. A bio-feedback function is planned for the ENERGIZING COACH in the medium term. This can reduce the feeling of stress with breathing exercises.",
            "With THERMOTRONIC automatic climate control (optional extra), Digital Vent Control enhances the comfort experience. It automatically adjusts the front air vents to a desired ventilation scenario. This can be done for each seat via the user profile, for example. However, the nozzles can also be aligned by hand as usual.",
            "Numerous driving assistance systems, some of which have been developed further",
            "The standard equipment of the E-Class with driving assistance systems includes Active Distance Assist DISTRONIC, ATTENTION ASSIST, Active Brake Assist, Active Lane Keeping Assist, Parking Package with reversing camera and Speed Limit Assist. The status and activity of the driving assistance systems are shown as a full-screen view in the Assistance mode of the driver's display.",
            "In conjunction with the camera, ATTENTION ASSIST now also offers a driver distraction warning in the 3D driver display (optional extra): if the driver's eyes are not focused on the road for several seconds, ATTENTION ASSIST can detect a distraction and warn the driver acoustically and visually. If the driver still fails to turn their attention to the traffic situation, there is an escalation with a second warning and a continuous warning tone. If the driver still fails to respond to the warning, the system can initiate an emergency stop by Active Emergency Stop Assist.",
            "The Driving Assistance Plus package is also offered as an optional extra, for example as part of the Premium package. Components include Active Steering Assist, which assists with lane-keeping. As already on motorways, the E-Class can now also restart automatically in city traffic and on country roads after a longer standstill. Another new feature: if Active Steering Assist is no longer available because the lane markings are not clearly visible, it signals this to the driver by vibrations in the steering wheel.",
            "Sophisticated body concept and coordinated restraint systems",
            "The safety concept of the Mercedes-Benz E-Class is based on a body with a particularly rigid passenger cell and specifically deformable crash structures. The restraint systems, e.g. seat belts and airbags, are specifically adapted to this. In the event of an accident, they can be activated in such a way that their protective effect for the occupants is adapted to the situation.",
            "In addition to driver and front passenger airbags, a knee airbag on the driver's side is also standard. It can protect the legs from contact with the steering column or instrument panel in a severe frontal crash. The standard window airbags can reduce the risk of head impact with the side window or penetrating objects. In the event of a serious side-on collision, the window airbag on the side of the impact extends from the A- to the C-pillar like a curtain over the front and rear side windows. If a rollover is detected, the window airbags can be activated on both sides. In addition to the head protection system, side airbags can also cover the thorax area in the event of a severe side impact - including on the outer rear seats (optional).",
            "In addition, the vehicles are equipped with a centre airbag, depending on the country. Pyrotechnic belt tensioners and force limiters are standard on all outer seats.",
            "Resource-conserving materials",
            "Numerous E-Class components are made partly from resource-saving materials (recyclates and renewable raw materials). Upholstery made of undyed alpaca wool combined with a recycled material is used for the basic seat of the E-Class. In the foam of the seats, certified recycled raw materials are used for the first time according to the \"mass balance approach\", and their properties do not differ from those of raw materials produced from crude oil. In this way, the need for fossil resources can be reduced while maintaining product quality.",
            "Neutral CO2 balance in production at the Sindelfingen plant",
            "Since 2022, Mercedes-Benz has been producing with a neutral CO2 balance in all of its own plants worldwide. The externally sourced electricity comes exclusively from renewable energies, and is therefore CO2-free. In addition, the company aims to increase the generation of renewable energy at its locations. Investments will be made in a further expansion of photovoltaics at the entire Sindelfingen location by the end of 2024. Another focus at the Sindelfingen location is on constantly reducing water consumption and the amount of waste produced.",
            "The E-Class as a long-standing success story",
            "Mercedes-Benz has produced more than 16 million upper mid-range vehicles since 1946. The heritage of the Mercedes-Benz E-Class goes back to the very early days of the brand. At the beginning of the 20th century, the preceding companies from which Mercedes-Benz emerged brought corresponding vehicles to market.",
            "When operations recommenced after the Second World War, the Model 170 V (W 136) originally introduced in 1936 went back into production. In 1947 the Saloon followed as the first post-war passenger car from Mercedes-Benz. The 180 model (W 120) of 1953 with self-supporting \"Ponton\" body introduced new technical as well as formal features. In 1961, the four-cylinder versions of the \"Tailfin\" series (W 110) followed. In 1968, the upper medium class of the \"Stroke/8\" series (W 114/115) signified the next major step. The succeeding 123 model series from 1976 proved even more successful.",
            "The 124 model series produced from 1984 to 1995 bore the name E-Class for the first time from mid-1993. The \"twin-headlamp\" face and innovative technology were the characteristic features of the 210 model series launched in 1995. The E-Class of model series 211 was launched in early 2002. The E-Class 212 (Saloon and Estate) and 207 (Cabriolet and Coupé) model series followed in 2009. The Mercedes-Benz E-Class model series 213 had its debut in 2016, and from 2017 for the first time also as an All-Terrain. In addition, there are the coupés and cabriolets of the 238 model series.",
            "Exterior design",
            "The new E-Class combines tradition and modernity: on the one hand, the model series continues the long model history of the classic Mercedes-Benz E-Class; on the other hand, its new appearance builds a bridge to the avant-garde trendsetters from Mercedes-EQ.",
            "The new E-Class has the proportions of a classic three-box saloon: the short front overhang and long bonnet are followed by a greenhouse which is set well back. The passenger area is generously dimensioned, partly owing to the two-centimetre longer wheelbase (2961 millimetres) compared to the preceding series. The \"cab-backward\" design is rounded off by the well-proportioned rear overhang. Among other things, the E-Class derives its status from the so-called prestige dimension, i.e. the distance from the front axle to the windscreen. Nevertheless, sportiness has not been sacrificed: powerdomes accentuate the bonnet. The flowing C-pillar has a dynamic effect. The new E-Class has a wide track (front/rear: 1634/1648 mm) and flush-fitted wheels measuring up to 21 inches.",
            "The two separate character lines on the side emphasise the car's sporty character. This shows off the elaborately designed surfaces to their best advantage. In line with the design philosophy of \"sensual purity\", the design team modelled a 3D sculpture with a special play of light. Chrome trim is discreetly and stylishly placed.",
            "A surprising feature at the front particularly illustrates the bridge between tradition and modernity: A black panel-like surface connects the radiator grille with the headlamps. This insert in high-gloss black is visually reminiscent of the Mercedes-EQ models. The three-dimensionally designed radiator grille is either progressive or classic, depending on the equipment line. In the Avantgarde version, the central star is integrated into the grille. Other design features of this line include a single louvre, grilles in a chrome star motif and chrome surrounds. In the Exclusive version, on the other hand, the radiator grille has three horizontal twin louvres. This variant also has an upright star on the bonnet.",
            "An illuminated radiator grille surround is optionally available for all lines. In this case there are two optical fibres behind the chrome strips. Light is fed into the glass-fibre bundles via LED modules. In addition to a Welcome and Leaving function, the radiator surround is illuminated in combination with the daytime running lights when driving.",
            "The new Mercedes-Benz E-Class has high-performance LED headlamps as standard. As an optional extra, DIGITAL LIGHT is available without and with a projection function. All headlamp variants offer a distinctive day and night design. As a typical feature of the brand, the daytime running lights take the shape of an eyebrow.",
            "The side view shows off the harmonious proportions and the distinctive \"cab-backward\" design to particularly good effect. The flush-fitting door handles familiar from the luxury Mercedes-Benz models are available as an option. They extend electrically when the driver approaches or strokes the outer surface of the door handle.",
            "Highlights at the rear include the two-section LED lights with a new contour and special design: the star motif in both light units provides a special day and night design. A light show is optionally available to welcome or bid farewell to passengers. The two rear lights are connected in the middle. This emphasises the width of the rear end, as does the v-shaped design of the boot lid and the chrome trim bar on its rear edge.",
            "Interior design",
            "The dashboard makes for the digital experience in the interior. If the Mercedes-Benz E-Class is equipped with the optional front passenger screen, the large glass surface of the MBUX Superscreen extends to the central display. Visually detached from this is the high-resolution driver display in the driver's field of vision.",
            "The contour of the cover glass is dynamic in design. For the central display, the glass surface is extended downwards accordingly. The profile becomes flat towards the outer edges. A narrow nozzle band nestles against the upper contour of the glass surface, connecting the central nozzle with the outer nozzles to form a single unit.",
            "The models without a passenger display feature a large trim element that extends to the centre. Visually detached, the central display appears to float above the concave surface of this trim element.",
            "The front section of the instrument panel is illuminated by the light strip of the Active Ambient Lighting. This runs in a wide arc from the windscreen, past the A-pillars and into the doors, so creating a spacious feeling in the way the door panels merge with the collar of the instrument panel to form a single unit. An apparently free-floating control array in the upper section of the door panels matches the look of the glass surfaces of the screens.",
            "The centre console is designed as a homogeneous unit and merges in a straight line into the lower section of the dashboard. At the front, a stowage compartment with lid and cup holders is integrated into the three-dimensionally shaped trim element. There is a soft padded armrest in the rear part of the centre console. USB ports are located in the compartment below.",
            "The door centre panel merges seamlessly into the armrest with a concave sweep. The front section here is designed as a metallic high-tech element. It serves as a grab and closing handle, and incorporates the switches for the power windows. Another highlight is the free-floating control array incorporating the door opener and the controls for the seat functions.",
            "The contours of the seat surface and backrest flow elegantly from the inside to the outside, and appear to float above the base of the seat thanks to their layer design. Indented vertical lines follow the outer contour, widening out towards the top. The association made here by the interior designers was with the organic beauty of shells. If the customer opts for leather upholstery, the seats are designed with elaborate longitudinal fluting, created in individual panels. The nappa leather seats feature quilted and perforated diamond patterns that follow the shape of the seat. The seat with MICROCUT offered as part of AMG Line interior is also perforated.",
            "Extensive range of interior colours and decorative trim",
            "The colour & trim concept conveys a technoid character. Mercedes-Benz E-Class buyers can choose between numerous interior colour combinations. The palette ranges from light beige combined with space grey, including a classy pearl effect, to the sophisticated tonka brown and the cool and technical-looking grey.",
            "The interior surfaces have a new fine-grain finish from the base trim level upwards, underlining the contemporary character. The interplay between analogue and digital sensory experience is further exemplified by the wide range of trims with innovative, natural or technoid surfaces. Exclusive to the E-Class is interior trim of open-pore wood - dark ash - which is backlit by the Mercedes-Benz pattern.",
            "In addition to other trim panels featuring open-pore woods, the \"MANUFAKTUR piano lacquer black flowing lines\" variant familiar from the S-Class is also available. Another highlight is interior trim in a silver-coloured metal-mix material. Its high-gloss finish gives it a very futuristic look.",
            "Customisable UI design",
            "The main icons on the central and optional passenger displays are now simpler, and also colour-coded to match smartphone tiles. This enables the driver to recognise them even more intuitively.",
            "With two display styles (Classic and Sporty) and three modes (Navigation, Assistance, Service), the graphics of the screens can be individualised. In the \"Classic\" style, the driver is greeted by the familiar display layout with the look of two dial instruments. Varying content with vehicle-related information is displayed between the two tubes.",
            "The \"Sporty\" style is dominated by the colour red, with a dynamically designed central rev counter. A holistically impressive colour experience is created in the interior by the optional seven colour themes of the ambient lighting.",
            "Aerodynamics and aeroacoustics",
            "With a Cd figure from 0.23, the new Mercedes-Benz E-Class performs very well in its vehicle segment. It therefore matches the excellent value achieved by its predecessor on market launch. The fact that this high level has been maintained with only a slight spread between the individual variants is remarkable. This is because certain factors make aerodynamic performance more difficult: these include the wide wheel portfolio from 17 to 21 inches as well as the rear-axle steering with additional steering arms and larger underbody cavities. At 0.236 sq. m., the frontal area A of the new E-Class is slightly larger than that of its predecessor (0.234 sq. m.).",
            "Many computer simulations at an early stage increased the degree of maturity. This made fewer optimisation loops necessary in the wind tunnel. In close cooperation with their design colleagues, the aerodynamics team has specifically improved the E-Class in numerous areas. Some details such as wheels with cladding inserts were adopted from the famously efficient Mercedes-EQ models. Here are the most important measures:",
            "\"Acoustic camera and acoustic holography\" with almost 500 microphones",
            "When it comes to aeroacoustic development, Mercedes-Benz always takes a dual approach: on the one hand, as little noise as possible should be generated at the source, i.e. when the air flows around the outer skin of the vehicle with all its mounted parts. And on the other hand, the quality of the sealing and sound insulation help to ensure that unavoidable wind noises are hardly perceptible in the interior, or not perceptible as disturbing.",
            "During the early development phase, the engineering team began to configure the geometric dimensions of the A-pillar and the exterior mirrors, which are particularly relevant for noise generation, accordingly. Advanced development methods using flow simulations and noise measurements were combined when optimising shapes: For the latter, a special microphone array was used in the acoustic wind tunnel. The extensive interior measurements are also called \"acoustic holography\". In this process, Mercedes-Benz uses 64 double microphones in the interior (hand array), which can locate problem areas in low-frequency ranges. Including the devices for outside measurements (\"acoustic camera\"), Mercedes-Benz uses almost 500 microphones.",
            "The high-frequency components of the wind noise were reduced by a variety of measures in the door seals, side windows and exterior mirrors. The structural rigidity of the doors was increased in the relevant areas. At very high driving speeds, this results in less wind noise. Cavities are foam-protected to improve the acoustic insulation in the body-in-white. This affects the structure of the cockpit cross-member and areas of the transmission tunnel and the A and C-pillars.",
            "In the panoramic sliding sunroof, many detailed improvements were made to the wind deflector and by adding side wind deflectors to the glass roof. The result is better noise comfort and reduced draughts. In the tilt position, the glass panel is lowered depending on the vehicle speed. This also ensures pleasant interior acoustics and reduces actual aerodynamic drag.",
            "Suspension",
            "The agile handling of the new Mercedes-Benz E-Class is due in large part to precise guidance of the front wheels by four control arms each. At the rear axle, an optimised multi-link independent rear suspension with five links ensures excellent wheel control and excellent straight-line stability. At both axles, the springs and dampers are combined in a single strut and are not involved in wheel guidance tasks, therefore the suspension responds with corresponding sensitivity. The front subframe and rear axle carrier decouple the suspension and body from vibrations and noise, and are part of the sophisticated comfort concept.",
            "As standard, the mild hybrid models are equipped with an AGILITY CONTROL steel spring suspension with selective damping system. It is also 15 millimetres lower than the suspension of the plug-in hybrids.",
            "The AIRMATIC air suspension system: level control included",
            "The new E-Class is available with the Technology package as an option. This includes the all-round AIRMATIC air suspension system with ADS+ continuously adjustable damping and rear-axle steering. The AIRMATIC suspension with air springs and adaptive ADS+ dampers responds very sensitively. The damping characteristics are controlled fully automatically for each individual wheel, and separately during rebound and compression. While driving, a sophisticated sensor system and algorithms set the dampers according to the quality of the road to ensure that, for example, driving over a bump with just one wheel is not transmitted to the entire axle and the interior.",
            "Level control is another feature of AIRMATIC. It keeps the ground clearance constant irrespective of the vehicle load, but also makes changes when needed. To reduce air resistance and thus fuel consumption, the vehicle level is automatically lowered by 15 millimetres from a speed of 120 km/h in the COMFORT driving mode. At the same time the vehicle's centre of gravity is lowered, which improves driving stability.",
            "Rear-axle steering: more agile and dynamic",
            "The new Mercedes-Benz E-Class is especially agile and stable with the optional rear-axle steering and the accompanying, more direct steering ratio at the front axle. The steering angle at the rear axle is up to 4.5 degrees. This reduces the turning circle by up to 90 centimetres In the E-Class models with 4MATIC, the turning circle is 11.1 metres instead of 12.0 metres, while in the rear-wheel drive versions it is reduced from 11.6 to 10.8 metres. The driver also needs fewer turns of the steering wheel from lock to lock. With rear-axle steering, it is 2.2 instead of 2.4 turns (figure rounded for rear and all-wheel drive).",
            "At speeds below 60 km/h, the rear wheels steer in the opposite direction to the front wheels - and by up to 4.5° against the front steering angle when parking. The wheelbase is therefore virtually shortened depending on the situation, making the vehicle more manoeuvrable, light-footed and agile. At speeds above 60 km/h, the rear wheels steer up to 2.5° in the same direction as the front wheels This virtual increase in wheelbase has noticeable advantages: in the form of improved handling stability and safety at high speeds, during fast lane-changes or sudden evasive manoeuvres.",
            "Moreover, considerably less steering input is required during dynamic manoeuvres, e.g. when driving on country roads - and the vehicle responds to steering movements in a more sporty manner. This is supported by the integrated dynamic control function of ESP®.",
            "Drive system",
            "Thanks to systematic electrification and intelligent downsizing, the new E-Class sets new standards in efficiency. Half of all the models will be fourth-generation plug-in hybrids. The model range already achieves this high proportion at market launch. Three of the six E-Class versions combine the advantages of a vehicle with combustion engine with those of an electric car.",
            "The combustion engines are four and six-cylinder units from the current modular Mercedes-Benz engine family FAME (Family of Modular Engines). Accordingly, the engine range plays a major role in the flexibility of the international production network, with needs-based electrification.",
            "In addition to turbocharging, both the diesel and petrol engines feature intelligent support from an integrated starter-generator (ISG). They are therefore mild hybrids. Thanks to a new battery, the power of the electric motor has been increased from 15 to 17 kW and the boost torque to 205 Nm.",
            "The ISG uses a 48 volt on-board electrical system that ensures functions such as gliding, boosting or energy recovery, and makes significant fuel savings possible. The engines also start very rapidly and comfortably as a result, so that the start/stop function is almost as imperceptible to the driver as the transition from gliding with the engine switched off to strong acceleration under engine power. When idling, the intelligent interaction between the ISG and the combustion engine ensures outstandingly smooth running.",
            "Petrol models: with many innovations compared to the preceding power units",
            "The four-cylinder petrol engine (M 254) is initially available in the Mercedes-Benz E-Class with 150 kW as the E 200 (WLTP: combined fuel consumption: 7.3-6.4 l/100 km, combined CO2 emissions: 166-144 g/km). Further output levels will follow. In the M 254, Mercedes-Benz has combined all the innovations of the FAME modular engine family in a single unit. They include NANOSLIDE® cylinder coating, CONICSHAPE® cylinder honing (trumpet honing) and the exhaust aftertreatment system positioned directly at the engine.",
            "A top model with an electrified in-line six-cylinder will round off the engine range at the top end.",
            "Diesel: current development level",
            "E 220 d (WLTP: combined fuel consumption: 5.5-4.8 l/100 km, combined CO2 emissions: 144-125 g/km) and E 220 d 4MATIC (WLTP: combined fuel consumption: 5.7-4.9 l/100 km, combined CO2 emissions: 149-130 g/km) powered by the OM 654 M. The electrification also includes the use of an electric refrigerant compressor for the air conditioning system.",
            "The OM654M in the E 220 d is charged by a single-stage turbocharger with variable turbine geometry and friction-optimised roller bearings. The turbocharger is tuned so that the engine responds quickly and delivers its power smoothly. The four-cylinder diesel is also up to date in terms of exhaust gas aftertreatment. Its components include:",
            "A more powerful variant with a six-cylinder engine will also soon follow in the diesel range.",
            "Transmission: automatic as standard",
            "The 9G-TRONIC transmission has been further developed and is used in all E-Class models. The electric motor, power electronics and transmission cooler have now moved into or to the transmission. Previously required lines are eliminated, which offers advantages with regard to installation space and weight. In addition, the efficiency of the transmission has been increased. Amongst other things, the optimised interplay with the electric auxiliary oil pump reduces the delivery rate of the mechanical pump by 30 percent compared with the predecessor - good for efficiency. Furthermore, it uses a new generation of the fully integrated transmission control with multi-core processor and new design and connectivity technology. In addition to the increased computing power, the number of electric interfaces has been drastically reduced, and the weight of the transmission controls have been cut by 30 percent compared with the predecessor.",
            "The 4MATIC drive system of the all-wheel drive models has been further improved. Front axle drive allows higher torques to be transmitted, and ideal axle load distributions can be achieved for good driving dynamics. Moreover, this has a significant weight advantage compared to the corresponding component in the preceding series - a contribution to CO2 reduction.",
            "Driving assistance systems",
            "The driving assistance systems with which the Mercedes-Benz E-Class is equipped as standard include ATTENTION ASSIST, Active Brake Assist, Active Lane Keeping Assist, Parking package with reversing camera and Speed Limit Assist. The status and activity of the driving assistance systems are shown as a full-screen view in the Assistance mode of the driver's display.",
            "The new ATTENTION ASSIST, in conjunction with the camera in the 3D driver display (optional extra) in the new E-Class, can not only detect signs of microsleep. ATTENTION ASSIST now also offers a driver distraction warning: if the driver's eyes are not focused on the road for several seconds, ATTENTION ASSIST can detect a distraction and warn the driver acoustically and visually. In addition, Active Brake Assist and Active Lane Keeping Assist temporarily switch to a sensitive mode. If the driver still fails to turn his/her attention to the traffic situation, there is an escalation with a second warning and a continuous warning tone. If the driver still fails to respond to the warning, the system can initiate an emergency stop by Active Emergency Stop Assist. The ATTENTION ASSIST distraction warning is active from 20 km/h.",
            "Active Distance Assist DISTRONIC is standard equipment In Western Europe. The system relieves the driver by regulating the speed to match that of slower vehicles ahead. The desired safety distance can be set in several increments. In an easy-to-understand way, the Get Started app in MBUX explains how Active Distance Assist DISTRONIC works.",
            "With extended functionality: the Driving Assistance Plus package",
            "The Driving Assistance Package Plus is available as an optional extra. Components include Active Steering Assist, which assists with lane-keeping. As previously on motorways, the Mercedes-Benz E-Class can now also start off automatically in city traffic and on country roads after coming to a standstill. This is possible in a time window of 30 seconds when the hands are on the steering wheel. Another new feature: if Active Steering Assist is no longer available because the lane markings are not clearly visible, it signals this to the driver by vibrations in the steering wheel. As before, if Steering Assist is not available, the steering wheel symbol in the driver display also changes from green to grey.",
            "Other features of this assistant include lane detection at low speeds additionally with 360° camera, very high availability and cornering performance on rural roads and improved lane centring on motorways. Depending on the situation, a driving position which is off the centre of the lane (e.g. formation of an emergency corridor, but also orientation via the edge of the carriageway on rural roads without centre markings) can be used.",
            "The other components of the Driving Assistance Plus package:",
            "Passive safety",
            "The safety concept of the Mercedes-Benz E-Class is based on an intelligently designed body with a particularly rigid passenger cell and specifically deformable crash structures. The restraint systems, e.g. seat belts and airbags, are specifically adapted to this. In the event of an accident, they can be activated in such a way that their protective effect for the occupants is adapted to the situation.",
            "With the aid of numerous numerical simulations, the safety experts at Mercedes-Benz have designed the vehicle structure for a high level of occupant protection. For the aspects of the vehicle configuration that are relevant in an accident, they not only took account of the legal requirements; they also considered internal requirements and test criteria derived from real-life accident findings.",
            "Modern restraint systems: protection for all passengers",
            "In addition to driver and front passenger airbags, a knee airbag on the driver's side is also standard. It can protect the legs from contact with the steering column or instrument panel in a severe frontal crash.",
            "The standard window airbags can reduce the risk of head impact with the side window or penetrating objects. In the event of a serious side-on collision, the window airbag on the side of the impact extends from the A- to the C-pillar like a curtain over the front and rear side windows. If a rollover is detected, the window airbags can be activated on both sides. In addition to the head protection system, side airbags can also cover the thorax area in the event of a severe side impact - including on the outer rear seats (optional).",
            "In addition, the vehicles are equipped with a centre airbag, depending on the country. This is integrated into the backrest of the driver's seat towards the centre console. It can position itself between the driver and the front passenger in the event of a severe side impact, depending on the direction of the impact, the severity of the accident and the occupancy status. Pyrotechnic belt tensioners and force limiters are standard on all outer seats.",
            "The Mercedes-Benz E-Class has i-Size child seat attachments as standard on the two outer seats in the second row. With two anchors each between the seat backrest and the seat cushion, corresponding child seats can be installed particularly quickly and securely. Top-tether attachment points on the rear of the rear seat backrests provide additional support. If a rear-facing child seat is placed in the front passenger seat, the vehicle can automatically deactivate the passenger airbag as required, depending on the market.",
            "Warnings: if the belt is not worn and people and animals are forgotten",
            "The European version of the E-Class not only has a seat belt status indicator for the rear, but also a sophisticated seat belt warning system. This warns if the seat is occupied and the seat belt is not fastened.",
            "The occupancy reminder can help to indicate people or animals that may have been overlooked in the rear of the vehicle. It activates and deactivates itself automatically if prolonged opening of a rear door indicates that somebody might enter or exit the vehicle.",
            "When the vehicle is switched off, the driver receives the text message \"Do not leave persons or animals behind\" on the driver's display if the system has activated automatically beforehand. The customer has the option to deactivate the system. An indicator light shows the status of the system.",
            "PRE-SAFE® system: precautionary protection",
            "In Europe, the PRE-SAFE® preventive occupant protection system is standard in the Mercedes-Benz E-Class as part of the Advanced package. This includes the known precautionary measures in the event of a recognised impending accident, including pre-conditioning of the hearing with PRE-SAFE® Sound.",
            "In conjunction with the Driving Assistance Plus package, PRE-SAFE® Impulse Side forms a kind of virtual crumple zone on the vehicle sides. As there is only a limited crumple zone available in a severe side impact, PRE-SAFE® Impulse Side can move the affected driver or front passenger away from the danger towards the centre of the vehicle even before the crash as soon as the system detects an impending side collision. To this end, air chambers in the side bolsters of the front seat backrest are inflated in fractions of a second before the collision."

Having acquired an electric vehicle named The Columbia Electric Carriage, he foresaw its suitability as a clean, noiseless alternative to the internal combustion engine - providing there was sufficient infrastructure to support it. Today, more than 120 years later, the time has come for Rolls-Royce Motor Cars to fulfil the prophecy of its founding father.",
            "This prophecy could not have been fulfilled without a more recent promise, when Rolls-Royce CEO, Torsten Müller-Ötvös, made a public commitment to electrification by announcing that he would bring a fully-electric Rolls-Royce to market within the current decade. Charles Rolls' prophecy and Torsten Müller-Ötvös' promise led to an historic moment. In September 2021, the marque confirmed that it had commenced testing of Spectre, the first Rolls-Royce to be conceived and engineered from the very beginning as an electric car.",
            "To ensure that this transformative motor car was sufficiently prepared for the most demanding consumer in the world - the Rolls-Royce client - the marque devised the most exhaustive testing programme it had ever conceived. Spectre is being subjected to a journey of more than 2.5 million kilometres, simulating more than 400 years of use for a Rolls-Royce. On its completion in 2023, Spectre will represent a prophecy fulfilled, a promise kept and an undertaking completed.",
            "Spectre is not only an historic moment for Rolls-Royce, but also an historic moment for electrification - with Spectre, the marque confirms that the technology has reached a standard that can contain the Rolls-Royce experience. To that end, Rolls-Royce has confirmed that by the end of 2030 its entire product portfolio will be fully-electric.",
            "THE FUTURE BEGINS",
            "Rolls-Royce Spectre is more than a motor car. It is a statement of intent and a symbol of a bright, bold future as Rolls-Royce progresses into an all-electric era. This commitment to an all-electric powertrain will only enhance the Rolls-Royce experience - instant torque, silent running and the sense of one imperceptible gear have defined the characteristics of an extraordinary canon of products dating back to the very first Rolls-Royce, the 1904 10 H.P.",
            "With Spectre, Rolls-Royce has harnessed a revolutionary 'Decentralised Intelligence' system that allows for the free and direct exchange of information between more than 1,000 vehicle functions, further elevating the marque's celebrated quality of ride. Its designers have captured a contemporary yet timeless aesthetic that significantly progresses the brand's iconography as it embarks on its electric age. Its craftspeople have created a suite of contemporary prêt-à-porter personalisation possibilities, including Starlight Doors and Illuminated Fascia, inspiring clients to realise their own Bespoke visions.",
            "DESIGN",
            "In unveiling Spectre, Rolls-Royce sets a new precedent in the creation of an entirely original class of motor car: the Ultra-Luxury Electric Super Coupé. This designation refers to Spectre's indulgent proportions, specified in response to a commitment that there is no greater luxury than that of space.",
            "The marque's designers are deeply rooted in the context occupied by their motor cars. Therefore, their inspiration is drawn from worlds far beyond automotive, including haute couture, modernist sculpture, nautical design, tailoring and contemporary art. In conceiving the principal sketches for Spectre, the marque's creatives were drawn to modern yacht concepts, specifically the clarity and precision of line, intelligent use of reflection and application of taper to emotionalise silhouettes.",
            "From the front, Rolls-Royce Spectre's split headlight treatment is intersected by the widest grille ever bestowed on a Rolls-Royce. The vanes of the Pantheon grille are now smoother in section and a flusher fit, designed to help guide the air around the motor car's front.",
            "The relaxed angle and polished stainless steel finish of the grille does much to enhance Spectre's presence using environmental reflection. Along with an aero-tuned Spirit of Ecstasy figurine - itself the product of 830 combined hours of design modelling and wind tunnel testing - the grille enhances the motor car's unprecedented drag coefficient, which at just 0.25cd makes Spectre Rolls-Royce's most aerodynamic motor car, ever.",
            "This intelligent treatment has been married to the iconography of Spectre's spiritual predecessor, the Phantom Coupé. Spectre clearly acknowledges its forebear with its generous proportions and split headlight treatment - a contemporary Rolls-Royce design tenet. Spectre's sharp daylight running lights emphasise the motor car's imperious two-metre width and are offset with lower lamp clusters that appear darkened, at first glance, but hide jewellery box-like darkened chromium housings for the headlights. To affirm Spectre's expression after dark, the grille is softly illuminated, with 22 LEDs lighting up the sandblasted rear side of each of the vanes, their gentle glow reflected in the polished front surfaces for a subtle and three-dimensional night signature.",
            "In profile, the sharp, vertical bow line at the front of Rolls-Royce Spectre draws the eye rearward to its monolithic flanks. The lower line - known as the 'waft line' - borrows directly from yacht design. Instead of exaggerating movement with busy detailing or appliqués, Spectre's coachwork gently tucks into the sill, lightening the surfacing and creating an uncomplicated sense of motion by reflecting the road passing beneath it, much as the hull of a racing yacht reflects the ocean as it cuts through water. This 'waft line' is the visual representation of the 'magic carpet ride' and its upwards sweep toward the front is inspired by the gently lifting bow of an accelerating power boat.",
            "The silhouette's most dramatic feature is Spectre's fastback, which recalls the most evocative motor cars and watercraft in history. The seamlessness of the greenhouse surfacing significantly contributes to achieving the lowest drag coefficient ever for a Rolls-Royce. Following the roofline back, the tail lamps are set into the largest single body panel ever produced for a Rolls-Royce, which extends from the A-pillar to the luggage compartment. The jewel-like vertical tail lamps themselves are colourless for neutrality, in anticipation of the myriad of colourways selected by clients during the commissioning process. Their precision and reduced dimension complement the generous flow of the bodywork from the muscular shoulders backwards into the tail section with its characteristic tapering plan view.",
            "The proportional demands of Spectre's scale required Rolls-Royce to embolden its wheel strategy. Spectre is the first production two-door coupé to be equipped with 23-inch wheels in almost one hundred years.",
            "Inside, Spectre is provisioned with the most technologically advanced Bespoke features yet, drawing inspiration from the timeless mystique of the night's sky. For the first time on a series production Rolls-Royce, Spectre is available with Starlight Doors, which incorporate 4,796 softly illuminated 'stars'. The coach doors can also be commissioned with a backdrop of wood Canadel Panelling, which takes its name from the cove in the South of France where Sir Henry Royce and his design team spent their winters.",
            "The ethereal night-time theme continues with Rolls-Royce Spectre's Illuminated Fascia. Developed over the course of two years and more than 10,000 collective hours, it incorporates the Spectre nameplate surrounded by a cluster of over 5,500 stars. Located on the passenger side of the dashboard, the illuminations are completely invisible when the motor car is not in operation.",
            "Alongside the extraordinary, illuminated surfaces, Spectre is equipped with a completely redesigned digital architecture of luxury named SPIRIT, presented in quintessential Rolls-Royce style. Not only will SPIRIT manage the motor car's functions, but it is seamlessly integrated into the marque's Whispers application, allowing clients to interact with their car remotely, and receive live information curated by the marque's luxury intelligence specialists.",
            "For the first time ever, clients are now able to extend their Bespoke commission beyond the physical world and into the digital architecture that underpins SPIRIT. Inspired by the marque's clients' love of bespoke timepieces, the colour of the dials can now complement the interior hue of the motor car.",
            "As with all Rolls-Royce motor cars, Spectre's interior suite offers clients near-infinite Bespoke possibilities. The all-new front seat design has been inspired by British tailoring, with lapel sections that can be rendered in contrasting or matching colours to the main base. Bespoke stitching, embroidery and intricate piping has, as ever, been considered in their inception.",
            "ALL-ALUMINIUM ARCHITECTURE OF LUXURY",
            "2003 saw the first Goodwood-era Phantom, built upon its own Bespoke architecture. This renaissance of the brand was Rolls-Royce 1.0. Following this, the 'Architecture of Luxury' was conceived - a new, highly flexible all-aluminium spaceframe architecture, and visionary feat of engineering, that could be tailored for electric drive, as well as today's Phantom, Cullinan and Ghost models, and Coachbuild projects. This expansion of the marque's offering was Rolls-Royce 2.0. The ability to tailor the Architecture of Luxury for electric drive was a fundamental consideration when it was first conceived. However, it is only now that electric drive technology is advanced enough to fulfil the Rolls-Royce experience. The introduction of a fully-electric powertrain and Decentralised Intelligence into the marque's portfolio represents Rolls-Royce 3.0 and the beginning of the bold new all-electric era.",
            "By ensuring from the outset that the Architecture of Luxury could be tailored to the requirements of an all-electric Rolls-Royce, the marque's engineers ensured the continuity of experience from its current portfolio, each evolution of which has done much to secure the brand's ongoing global success. Indeed, the inherent flexibility of the architecture and ease of integration of an electric powertrain has freed engineers, designers and craftspeople to focus on the quality of experience, authenticity of design and innovation in Bespoke.",
            "For Spectre, Rolls-Royce engineers have unlocked further benefits. The sophisticated extruded aluminium sections and integration of the battery into the structure of the motor car enable it to be 30% stiffer than any previous Rolls-Royce. The flexibility of the architecture has also allowed engineers to place the floor halfway between the sill structures rather than on top or underneath them. A channel has been created for wiring and climate control pipework between the battery and the floor, with the battery mounted underneath, providing a perfectly smooth underfloor profile. This not only creates a low seating position and enveloping cabin but realises a secondary function for the battery - almost 700kg of sound deadening.",
            "DIGITAL ENGINEERING",
            "For Spectre, Rolls-Royce's engineers have seen much of their discipline pivot from the workshop to the digital space. Spectre is the most connected Rolls-Royce in history, and in harnessing the power of the motor car's remarkable Decentralised Intelligence processing capabilities there is more requirement than ever for expert human experience.",
            "To ensure the continuity of the Rolls-Royce experience, as well as its progression, the marque selected the most experienced test and development engineers to lead the project, some of whom have been with the marque for more than two decades and were responsible for creating the first 'Goodwood-era' Phantom. These engineers describe the experience offered by Spectre as akin to \"Rolls-Royce in high definition\" on account of the speed and accuracy of the motor car's response to a worldwide spread of road and weather conditions.",
            "For this to be realised, a dedicated control has been handmade for each of the 141,200 sender-receiver variables, and in nearly all cases engineers have designed several more sub-variables for variations in climate, ground speed, road type, vehicle status and driving style. These have been crafted over the course of Spectre's 2.5 million kilometre testing programme both on advanced proving grounds and on real roads around the world.",
            "PLANAR SUSPENSION",
            "In testing Rolls-Royce Spectre, the process includes extreme driving conditions - development of the motor car began just 55km from the arctic circle in Arjeplog, Sweden, at temperatures as low as -40 degrees centigrade, and it will continue across Southern Africa, in temperatures of up to 55 degrees centigrade. Yet, 55% of testing is taking place on the very roads that many production Spectres will be driven on. Of particular significance was the French Riviera. It was on the Côte d'Azur that Spectre's digitally integrated evolution of the renowned Planar suspension system was finalised.",
            "Planar suspension is an orchestra of systems with precisely defined responses to driver inputs and road conditions, made possible by the latest software and hardware developments, delivering Rolls-Royce's hallmark 'magic carpet ride'.",
            "Using a suite of new hardware components and leveraging Spectre's high-speed processing capabilities, the Planar system can decouple the car's anti-roll bars allowing each wheel to act independently, preventing the rocking motion that occurs when one side of a vehicle hits an undulation in the road. This also reduces high-frequency ride imperfections caused by shortcomings in road surface quality.",
            "Once a corner is identified as imminent, the Planar system recouples the components and stiffens the dampers, the four-wheel steering system is then prepared for activation to ensure effortless entry and exit. Under cornering, 18 sensors are monitored, and steering, braking, power delivery and suspension parameters are adjusted so that Spectre remains stable. The result is effortless control.",
            "ENGINEERING",
            "The first Goodwood-era Rolls-Royce, launched in 2003, was Phantom. Underpinned by its own Bespoke architecture, this was Rolls-Royce 1.0. For its successor, the marque created the 'Architecture of Luxury' (see below) - an all-aluminium spaceframe that also provides the foundations for Cullinan and Ghost - representing Rolls-Royce 2.0. With its fully-electric powertrain and Decentralised Intelligence, Spectre marks the start of Rolls-Royce 3.0, and a new era for super-luxury motoring.",
            "All-aluminium Architecture of Luxury",
            "Spectre is the fourth series Rolls-Royce to be built on the Architecture of Luxury platform, which is unique and proprietary to Rolls-Royce Motor Cars. In a farsighted move reminiscent of Charles Rolls' famous prophecy, it was deliberately conceived from the outset to accommodate an electric powertrain as and when the technology became available.",
            "It comprises an all-aluminium spaceframe that is infinitely scalable and modifiable around four fixed points, one at each corner of the motor car. This inherent flexibility allows Rolls-Royce to adjust the bulkhead, floor, crossmembers and sill panels in a way most appropriate to each individual product.",
            "With Spectre, Rolls-Royce engineers unlocked previously unexplored potential in the concept. The sophisticated extruded aluminium sections and integration of the battery into the structure make Spectre's spaceframe 30% stiffer than in any previous Rolls-Royce. The architecture also allowed engineers to place the floor halfway between the sill structures rather than above or underneath them.",
            "A channel for wiring and climate control pipework runs between the battery and the floor, with the battery mounted underneath, producing a perfectly smooth underfloor profile. This allows a low seating position, while moving the bulkhead location deepens the dashboard to create a truly cocooning passenger cabin. This sensation is amplified by Spectre's dramatically raked windscreen, which also contributes to the car's exceptional aerodynamics (see below).",
            "The battery's position gives it a highly beneficial secondary function: fully integrated into the motor car's architecture, it acts as 700kg of additional acoustic insulation.",
            "All-electric drivetrain",
            "With Spectre, Rolls-Royce committed to an uncompromised electric future by specifying an all-electric drivetrain rather than a hybrid solution. It is fitted with two Separately Excited Synchronous Motors (SSMs). The front electric motor produces 190kW / 365 Nm, with the rear motor delivering 360kW / 710 Nm. In performance terms, this equates to an internal combustion engine of 430kW (584 hp) with 900Nm of torque. In terms of acceleration, Spectre achieves 0-60mph in 4.4 seconds (0-100km/h in 4.5 seconds).",
            "In establishing an appropriate range for Spectre, the marque first engaged with clients, to understand their requirements. The confirmed range of 530km (329 miles) WLTP goes beyond these requirements, confirming that Spectre fits perfectly into the lifestyle of Rolls-Royce clients, who have an average of more than seven cars in their garage to choose from for any occasion, and who drive an average of 5,100km in their current Rolls-Royce per year.",
            "Charge time from 10-80% is 34 minutes using a 195 kW (DC) fast charger: this will also produce sufficient charge for 100km in around nine minutes.",
            "Spectre is equipped with Active Lane Centring and Adaptive Cruise Control simultaneously.",
            "Battery",
            "Spectre has a 102kWh lithium-ion battery, made using cobalt and lithium from strictly controlled sources in Australia, Morocco and Argentina: the battery cells are produced using 100% green electricity. It has been extensively tested in temperatures ranging from -40°C to +50°C: Spectre's on-board thermal management system maintains an optimum operating temperature at all times.",
            "Braking recuperation",
            "Spectre has a braking recuperation function that the driver can configure by pushing a button marked 'B' on the Column Shifter. By activating 'Brake Mode', braking recuperation is increased, enabling so-called single-pedal driving and even allowing the car to come to a complete stop if desired. The default setting on starting is low recuperation, mimicking the automatic driving style of an internal combustion engine Rolls-Royce.",
            "Digital Engineering",
            "Spectre is the most connected Rolls-Royce in history, with three times as many sender-receiver signals as any previous model. Indeed, engineers describe it as 'Rolls-Royce in ultra-high definition' on account of the speed and accuracy of its responses to road and weather conditions. Each of the car's thousands of drivetrain and chassis characteristics were exhaustively tested and refined during its 2.5-million-kilometre testing programme.",
            "Through a software architecture known as Decentralised Intelligence, data is processed closer to its source rather than being handled in its entirety by a single central processing unit. To achieve this, each of the 141,200 sender-receiver variables has its own dedicated handmade control; in nearly all cases, several additional sub-variables account for variations in climate, ground speed, road type, vehicle status and driving style. This enables the car to respond more quickly to driver inputs and changing road conditions.",

A strut tower brace, multiple reinforcement panels for the strut towers themselves, and radiator support braces are also used to enhance front-end stiffness.",
            "The suspension is tuned for ideal responsiveness for the chassis. The front suspension features a strut angle that aligns at the ideal angle to improve ride quality. The Dynamic Control Shocks are capable of responding to even the smallest movements thanks to a non-overlapping auxiliary valve that allows damper oil to flow in either direction before entering the main valve. The rear suspension design utilizes a trailing arm and a multilink setup that also benefits from the responsiveness of the Dynamic Control Shocks. Higher placement of the trailing arm mounting point and a larger bushing size assist in dampening road irregularities. Wider spacing of the stabilizer bushing mounts can also contribute to overall roll reduction.",
            "The ES 350 is powered by a 3.5-liter V6 that is designed to deliver responsive acceleration along with impressive efficiency. The V6 features the D-4S fuel injection system, which uses high-pressure injectors to deliver fuel directly into the combustion chamber along with a low-pressure system that delivers fuel to the intake ports. Together with the addition of Variable Valve Timing-intelligence Wide (VVT-iW) for the intake valves, the engine is capable of operating on either the traditional Otto cycle during sporty driving or the more efficient Atkinson cycle when power demand is low.",
            "The 3.5-liter V6 is rated to produce 302 horsepower at 6,600 rpm and 267 lb-ft of torque at 4,700 rpm with an EPA-estimated MPG rating of 22/32/26 (city/highway/combined). To complement the power of the updated V6, an 8-speed Direct Shift automatic transmission is also used.",

            "The roots of the McLaren Solus GT are in a stunning concept that featured in the Gran Turismo SPORT video game.",
            "From the original design sketches through to the virtual gaming triumph and now the astonishing machine that an exclusive few customers will enjoy on track, this is a car that epitomises the 'everything for a reason' design philosophy and relentless pursuit of engineering excellence within every McLaren. From the outset, the concept was based on proven aerodynamic principles, with a sports-prototype racecar package as its foundation.",
            "The bodywork is very much a technical sculpture, shrink-wrapped over the high-performance engineering package and the two full-length ground effect tunnels. These contain distinctive air intakes at the front and a NACA duct - a low-drag air inlet - which also acts as a step, accelerating the airflow into the radiators.",
            "From the front, the distinctive McLaren 'hammerhead' nose helps to separate airflow from the underbody ground effects and the full-length diffuser. The visibility from the wraparound canopy screen of the teardrop cockpit is outstanding, with an uncluttered, 180-degree view of a track. The wheel pods in each corner are not only a dominating design feature, they also allow overall weight-reduction and individually 'work' the airflow with a distinctive tear-drop shape that ends in a dramatic blade-like rear edge to calm the turbulent air in the wake of each tyre and mitigate pressure build-up within the wheel well.",
            "The rear of the car features a full clam that provides easy access to the engine bay, with super-low trailing bodywork edges that employ the same principles as the Speedtail in order to minimise base pressure across the back of the car, reducing drag.",
            "Engineering a virtual design into extreme reality",
            "The original engineering brief for the McLaren Solus GT was to turn a prestigious virtual gaming concept into an extremely powerful and highly exclusive McLaren hypercar. This was to be a track-only car, with motorsport engineering expertise and a V10 powertrain coming together to deliver the supreme driver engagement demanded for a no-compromises experience.",
            "The racing-derived engine was chosen for reasons of packaging as well as performance; a pared-down track car with minimal weight and shrink-wrapped bodywork meant having the engine as part of the chassis was a natural choice. This construction technique is rarely seen in production cars for NVH (Noise, Vibration, Harshness) reasons, but in a focused track car it gives many benefits, not least added feedback and exhilarating engagement for the driver.",
            "Once the programme parameters were set, the engineering team faced the challenge of integrating real-world aerodynamic performance into the original design surfaces. This was resolved with extensive Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and wind-tunnel work to prove the aerodynamic, cooling and efficiency properties of the concept.",
            "Racing-inspired chassis design and construction",
            "Like every McLaren built in the last 40 years, the Solus GT features a carbon-fibre monocoque at its heart. However, the single-seat cockpit and production-based engineering processes demanded a bespoke approach embracing the differing disciplines of competition and road car construction and the resulting design takes greater inspiration from motorsport than other McLaren Automotive products, with the monocoque using Formula 1 and sportscar racing chassis technologies. The front and rear impact structures are made from carbon fibre - traditionally McLaren Automotive chassis structures feature aluminium structures fixed to the passenger cell - and with the engine and gearbox both stressed chassis members, there is no requirement for a rear subframe.",
            "The construction of the chassis employs specialist low-volume production methods including a carbon 'pre-preg' process whereby the carbon fibre is pre-impregnated with a resin system that simplifies the curing process. The material is ready to lay into the mould before heat and pressure treatment is applied, allowing the higher structural strength demanded by a track-only car. The process also allows a high uniformity of finish to the material that enhances visual appeal.",
            "The chassis of the McLaren Solus GT also features 3D-printed titanium components, including the halo cockpit protection structure and roll hoop. While previously used by McLaren Automotive- notably for the exhaust system of the Elva - this is the first use of the technology for structural components in a McLaren production car and demonstrates the absolute focus applied to finding the best solutions for the Solus GT.",
            "Refined and optimised bodywork and aerodynamics",
            "Despite the freedom the development team enjoyed in exploring the boundaries of possibilities for the Solus GT as a track car, the exterior design of the virtual reality concept did impose restrictions on what could be done if the real car was to retain the 'wow factor' of the car that featured in Gran Turismo SPORT.",
            "As befits an ultra-lightweight track-only car, the bodywork of Solus GT is made from carbon fibre; the complex shapes and swooping lines achieved without the weight penalties that would come from the use of conventional metal panels. The form of these has been finely honed - ironically in virtual reality - to ensure stability and maximise aerodynamic efficiency for both straight line-speed and downforce.",
            "A large front splitter feeds air into ground-effect tunnels in the full structural floor, which has been designed to accept high aerodynamic loads. The air exits the car via a full diffuser. The front wheels are outboard of the main bodywork, with the suspension wishbones exposed to the airflow and shrouded in aerodynamically-shaped carbon fibre that directs air towards the sidepod-mounted radiators. The sidepod-siting of the high-temperature radiators is directly inspired by motorsport, providing a direct cooling solution for engine fluids and reducing frontal surface area.",
            "A motorsport-inspired air intake above the cockpit, which is integrated into the design of the roll hoop cover, takes in cold and flow-conditioned air above the car while also creating a pleasingly engaging engine induction sound.",
            "The twin-element, fixed rear wing is one of the more distinctive visual features of Solus GT. Designed to maximise downforce over the rear of the car, it works alongside the combination of high-downforce ground effect and low pitch sensitivity from the motorsport-derived suspension system, to negate the need for active front or rear wings and so help to keep weight down.",
            "Overall, the aerodynamic package downforce exceeds the total weight of the car, but the downforce to drag ratio is also optimised, aiding straight-line performance and enhancing cornering speeds.",
            "Unique, single central seat interior",
            "The Solus GT McLaren driving experience begins even before the V10 engine is started - simply stepping into the cockpit is an event in itself. Instead of signature McLaren dihedral doors, a sliding canopy - more akin to that of a fighter jet - is opened using a mechanical lever. The spring-loaded canopy moves through a shallow arc, lifting clear of the cockpit and sliding forwards to allow easy access to the driving seat.",
            "Recent technological safety innovations from the top tiers of motorsport are integrated in the design, with the canopy reinforced by a halo-style structure to protect the driver. An escape hatch is also built into the canopy to allow safe departure from the cockpit should the sliding mechanism be obstructed.",
            "The interior is purpose-built for extreme track performance; an owner can specify their car with an entirely bespoke environment, but it will remain focused on the driving experience. The moulded seat is fitted with a 6-point harness and is fixed in position; instead, the pedal box is adjustable as in a race car, but with the convenience of being able to be operated from a sitting position.",
            "To ensure the single seat is a perfect fit for the customer, MSO has adopted a process taken from motorsport which is yet another example of the full range of McLaren expertise being available for the Solus GT. A phenolic resin-based system with advanced micro-bead technology is used to create a mould from which the seat is created, ensuring in turn that the driver remains comfortable in the car throughout the most intense track driving sessions.",
            "Almost all controls are concentrated on the steering wheel, which is constructed from carbon fibre. Inspired directly by motorsport, all essential functions are easily reached with both hands on the wheel. A full HVAC air system also keeps the driver fully alert throughout the driving experience.",
            "Above the driver's head are switches for vehicle ignition and the fully plumbed-in emergency fire extinguisher. This area also houses the rear-view display, streamed in real-time from a camera located on the roll hoop behind the driver's head. The wide-angle camera provides a comprehensive rear view of the track to allow traffic to pass on a slowing-down lap or aid pit-lane manoeuvring.",
            "Powertrain with a proven motorsport pedigree",
            "The 5.2-litre V10 engine specified to power the McLaren Solus GT is incorporated into the vehicle chassis structure. The engine capacity is unique to the Solus GT, as are the air intake and exhaust system. The induction system directs air towards barrel throttles that are individual to each cylinder - a technology that is not suitable for road use but offers clear advantages in engine performance, including improved throttle response.",
            "The engine also incorporates low-volume machined components optimised for performance and is entirely gear-driven; there are no chains or belts for ancillary systems. Output is greater than 840PS, with the full benefit of the ram effect provided by the high air intake and the engine revving past 10,000rpm. Maximum torque is in excess of 650Nm.",
            "The resulting performance is a target acceleration time of 2.5 seconds from standstill to 100km/h and a maximum speed in excess of 200mph, despite the Solus GT generating downforce that exceeds its weight.",
            "Competition gearbox",
            "The McLaren Solus GT has a seven-speed sequential gearbox, with race-proven internals located within a bespoke casting and casing, designed as a mounting point for the rear suspension. The casing is made from aluminium, with magnesium panels optimising weight.",
            "Originally designed for LMP sportscar applications, the gearbox internals include straight-cut gears, a technology not usually incorporated in production cars for reasons of NVH refinement but acknowledged as providing greater efficiency than helical-cut gears in a high-performance track car.",
            "The gearbox is engaged by a carbon fibre clutch, designed to complement aggressive gearshift strategy demanded in a track application. It is though also fully automated and controlled by software - removing the need for a pedal or lever-operated clutch control - to aid the driver when pulling away from the pit-lane.",
            "Track-focused suspension design",
            "The McLaren Solus GT was designed from the outset as a track-only car and its suspension follows the principles of motorsport engineering, starting with the wheels located via double wishbones. With the front wheels mounted outboard of the main body, the front damping is inboard with pushrods operating torsion bars and corner dampers. At the rear, the bars are linked to pullrods, and the rear suspension is mounted to the gearbox casing.",
            "The wishbones and rods are fabricated from steel for enhanced durability, but the front suspension links are encased in carbon fibre shrouds for aerodynamic efficiency. The system also incorporates ride height springs and a heave spring and damper system. This is employed to provide stiffness at speed by limiting vertical movement, the effect of this is to create a more aerodynamically stable profile, making the car's dynamic behaviour at speed more predictable and therefore increasing driver confidence on high-speed tracks.",
            "Housed within the distinctive wheel pods are 18-inch forged aluminium wheels with centre locking nuts, shod with Le Mans Prototype-specification tyres available in both slick and wet compounds. Braking is provided by 6-piston monobloc machined aluminium calipers with carbon brake discs and pads. Bias between the front and rear brakes can be adjusted by the driver in the cockpit.",
            "Each axle is linked by anti-roll bars, which are connected via drop links. Both bars are adjustable.",
            "The complete - and bespoke - MSO customer journey",
            "Solus GT showcases the level of craftmanship available to McLaren customers through McLaren Special Operations.",
            "From the beginning of the development process, individual presentations were given to customers wishing to secure one of the 25 cars available. This has previously taken place only for purchasers of the McLaren Sabre, a car homologated for the US market only, whereas with Solus GT being a track-only product, the customer base is global.",
            "The 25 Solus GT depositors have also been involved throughout in the finer details of the car's development from the virtual world to the real world, with new, MSO-developed software at the core of realising the vision of each customer. This bespoke, individual approach reflects an intimate accessibility to McLaren that goes beyond even the usual levels of luxury experience and engagement."

            "The S-Class has always played an important role for Mercedes-AMG. More than 50 years ago, the founders already proved that they could transform a luxury saloon into a very sporty vehicle with the Swabian spirit of innovation. The performance and sports car brand from Affalterbach set its first milestone in 1971, with the Mercedes-Benz 300 SEL 6.8 AMG. Today, the new Mercedes-AMG S63 E PERFORMANCE with AMG hybrid technology once again sets the benchmark in the segment. The E PERFORMANCE model combines the AMG 4.0-litre V8 biturbo engine with the AMG-specific hybrid powertrain and a new expansion stage of the AMG high-performance battery (HPB). The new HPB 150 is based on the high-performance and directly cooled battery cells of the well-known HPB 80. The energy content increases from 6.1 in the HPB 80 to 13.1 kWh in the HPB 150. This increases the all-electric range to 33 kilometres.",
            "The focus of the powertrain, however, is less on electric range and more on best-in-class performance. With 590 kW (802 hp) of system output and 1430 Nm of system torque, the saloon sets new standards in the segment. The acceleration of 3.3 seconds to 100 km/h and the optional top speed of 290 km/h underline the superior, dynamic driving performance. Systems such as the AMG RIDE CONTROL+ suspension, AMG ACTIVE RIDE CONTROL roll stabilisation and rear-axle steering as standard ensure a wide spread between driving dynamics and comfort.",
            "\"The S-Class has always had a very special meaning for us. In 1971, it made the AMG brand famous overnight with its legendary appearance in the Spa 24-hour race. This was undoubtedly an important foundation stone for our rise as a performance and sports car brand with global significance. With E PERFORMANCE, we are now opening a new chapter: Never before has a luxury saloon so perfectly combined best-in-class performance with superior comfort and virtually silent electric driving. In this way, we are also opening up to highly discerning target groups who see Mercedes-AMG as the performance luxury brand of the 21st century. With the most powerful S-Class of all time, however, we are not only going our own technical way, as is characteristic of AMG, but also making a strong visual statement: For the first time, the S-Class Saloon also has our AMG-specific radiator grille, so the brand affiliation is closer than ever before.\"Philipp Schiemer, Chairman of the Board of Management of Mercedes-AMG GmbH",
            "\"With our unique E PERFORMANCE in the AMG S-Class, we are also setting another technological milestone in electrification in this segment. Our exclusive high-performance battery is used in the S63 with a significantly higher capacity than previously known, which increases the electric range. The performance hybrid layout with a combustion engine at the front and an electric drive unit at the rear axle not only offers a superior driving experience, but also significantly increases efficiency. The optimised weight distribution, best possible utilisation of torque and the very responsive power delivery promise driving dynamics and driving refinement at the highest level. In addition to the technically sophisticated powertrain, we also pulled out all the stops with the suspension to achieve the greatest possible spread between comfort and driving dynamics. For example, the combination of air suspension, rear-axle steering and active roll stabilisation is on board for the first time in an AMG S-Class.\" Jochen Hermann, Technical General Manager of Mercedes-AMG GmbH",
            "Expressive exterior design",
            "The impressive performance of the Mercedes-AMG S63 E PERFORMANCE is also suggested by the expressive exterior design. For the first time, an S-Class Saloon bears the AMG-specific radiator grille with vertical louvres and a large central star. The previous Mercedes star on the radiator has been replaced by the AMG emblem in silver chrome/black. In addition, the front apron in jet-wing design with large side air inlets and functional air curtains characterises the front view. In the side view, the up to 21-inch AMG forged wheels and the AMG-specific side sill panels particularly stand out. At the rear, there are characteristic design features of the '63 models such as the trapezoidal, fluted twin tailpipes or the wide diffuser with longitudinal fins and diffuser board.",
            "Elegant interior with First-Class rear compartment",
            "The interior combines the high-quality appointments of the S-Class with AMG-specific features. The seats with a special AMG upholstery layout and distinctive stitching underline the refined appearance. Exclusive colours and various nappa leather upholsteries with an embossed AMG emblem in the front head restraints emphasise either the sporty or the luxurious side of the S63 E PERFORMANCE. The leadership aspirations in the segment are also made clear by the First-Class rear compartment and multicontour seats for four occupants. Added to this are AMG-specific trim elements and the standard AMG Performance steering wheel with AMG steering wheel buttons.",
            "MBUX multimedia system with hybrid-specific displays",
            "The MBUX infotainment system includes various AMG- and hybrid-specific displays and functions. These include the displays in the instrument cluster, on the multimedia central display in portrait orientation in the centre console and the optional head-up display.",
            "The instrument cluster view can be personalised with different display styles and individually selectable main views. The AMG-specific Supersport style offers the option of displaying various contents via a vertical menu structure. These include a menu with hybrid-specific temperatures or a set-up menu that displays the current settings for the suspension or transmission. In addition, Supersport-style drivers can also have a navigation map, fuel consumption data or all the telemetric data available in AMG TRACK PACE displayed.",
            "The head-up display also offers AMG's own display styles such as Race and Supersport. These can be accessed via the main menu in the instrument cluster. High-quality graphics in the multimedia display visualise the power flow of the entire drive system, speed, output, torque and temperature of the electric motor, as well as the battery temperature.",
            "The Dolby Atmos® sound format takes the interior audio experience to a new level. Individual instruments or voices in the studio mix can be positioned all around the listening area. A new kind of sound animation thus becomes possible: While conventional stereo systems feed two channels to the speakers, Dolby Atmos® can use the entire range and create a 360-degree experience.",
            "AMG Performance steering wheel in twin-spoke design",
            "The AMG Performance steering wheel with its distinctive twin-spoke design and seamlessly integrated gearshift buttons also contributes to the hallmark AMG look. The AMG steering wheel buttons impress with their brilliant displays and intuitive operating logic. They allow important driving functions and all driving modes to be controlled without the driver's hands leaving the steering wheel. The recuperation levels of the hybrid drive can also be selected via the steering wheel buttons.",
            "The AMG-specific E PERFORMANCE hybrid drive: combustion engine in the front, electric motor in the rear",
            "In the new Mercedes-AMG S63 E PERFORMANCE, the 4.0-litre V8 biturbo engine is combined with a permanently excited synchronous electric motor, a high-performance battery developed in Affalterbach and the fully variable AMG Performance 4MATIC+ all-wheel drive system. The system output of 590 kW (802 hp) and the maximum system torque of 1430 Nm make for impressive driving performance: Acceleration from standstill to 100 km/h takes just 3.3 seconds. Power delivery only ends at an electronically governed 290 km/h (with the optional AMG Driver's Package).",
            "The 140 kW (190 hp) electric motor is positioned at the rear axle, where it is integrated with an electrically shifted two-speed transmission and the electronically controlled limited-slip rear differential to form a compact electric drive unit (EDU). Experts refer to this layout as a P3 hybrid. The high-performance battery is also located in the rear above the rear axle.",
            "The decisive advantage of this EDU position is bypassing of the 9-speed transmission, which is flanged to the V8 engine. As it is positioned behind the transmission, the torque of both drive units can be fully utilised. The result: 1430 Nm of system torque - a new record in this class. And there are many more arguments in favour of the P3 setup as a performance hybrid:",
            "Permanently excited synchronous motor (PSM)",
            "The PSM is equipped with a hollow rotor made of permanent magnets and can thus be installed around the output shaft to the left rear wheel. The electric motor is controlled by power electronics, which are likewise located at the EDU and convert accelerator pedal commands directly to suitably actuate the PSM. In addition, the sensitive control of the electric motor adjusts the speed during gearshifts by the two-speed transmission. This means that the transmission in the EDU does not require any mechanical synchronisation at all. The boost torque of the electric motor can thus also be used at higher speeds. The maximum torque of an electric motor is available from the first revolution, but drops again later at higher rpm. Therefore the second gear, which is engaged at higher speeds, brings the electric motor into a range with lower rpm, so that it can support the combustion engine over the entire speed range.",
            "Inspired by Formula 1™, developed in Affalterbach: the AMG high-performance battery",
            "When the electrification strategy was being defined, it was clear from the outset that all essential components would be developed in Affalterbach. Among these is the AMG high-performance battery (HPB). The development of the lithium-ion energy storage system is inspired by technologies that have proven themselves in the Mercedes-AMG Petronas F1 Team's Formula 1 hybrid racing cars. The team of experts from the Formula 1 engine manufacturer High Performance Powertrains (HPP) in Brixworth collaborated closely with Mercedes-AMG in Affalterbach. The AMG high-performance battery combines high power that can be called up in rapid succession with low weight to enhance the overall performance of the vehicle. Added to this are the fast energy draw and the high power density.",
            "70 kW continuous output and 140 kW peak output",
            "The high-performance battery in the S63 E PERFORMANCE has a capacity of 13.1 kWh, more than twice as much as the already familiar HPB 80. It delivers 70 kW of continuous mechanical power and 140 kW of peak mechanical power (for ten seconds) to the electric motor. External charging takes place via the 3.7 kW onboard AC charger, at a charging station, wallbox or household socket. The battery is designed for fast power delivery and draw, not for the longest possible range. Nevertheless, the electric range of 33 kilometres allows a practical operating radius, for example for quiet all-electric driving from a residential area.",
            "The continual push for innovation: direct cooling of the battery cells",
            "The basis for the high performance of the AMG 400-volt battery is direct cooling: A high-tech coolant based on an electrically non-conductive liquid flows around all 1200 cells and cools them individually. Every battery needs a defined temperature for optimum power delivery. If the energy storage unit gets too cold or too hot, it temporarily loses noticeable power or has to be turned down in order not to be damaged if the temperature level is too high. The consistent temperature of the battery therefore has a decisive influence on its performance, service life and safety. Conventional cooling systems, which use only air or cool the entire battery pack indirectly with water, quickly reach their limits If the thermal management does not fulfil its function optimally, the battery is at risk of ageing prematurely.",
            "For direct cooling, the AMG team had to develop new cooling modules of millimetric thickness. Around 14 litres of coolant circulate from top to bottom through the entire battery, past each cell, with the help of a specially developed high-performance electric pump. In the process, the coolant also flows through an oil/water heat exchanger attached directly to the battery. This conducts the heat into one of the two low-temperature circuits (LT) of the vehicle. From there, it goes on to the LT cooler at the front of the car, which releases the heat into the outside air. The system is designed to ensure even heat distribution in the battery.",
            "The result is that the battery is always within a consistent, optimum operating temperature window averaging 45 degrees Celsius, no matter how often it is charged or discharged. It may well be that the average temperature is exceeded when driving at high speeds. The protection mechanisms are therefore set in such a way that the maximum power can be drawn from the battery in order to subsequently lower the temperature level again through direct cooling. Conventional cooling systems cannot cope with this, and the battery can no longer fully utilise its capacity. Not so the AMG High Performance Battery: Even under heavy load, where acceleration (battery is discharged) and deceleration (battery is charged) are frequent, the battery retains its high performance capacity.",
            "Only effective direct cooling makes it possible to use cells with a very high power density. Thanks to this individual solution, the battery system is particularly light and compact. The material-saving conductor rail concept also contributes to the low weight. The light but at the same time robust crash structure of the aluminium housing ensures maximum safety.",
            "Regeneration selectable in four stages",
            "Because the high-performance battery is always in the optimum temperature window of around 45 degrees, recuperation can also be optimised: Normally, a battery heats up strongly at high regeneration capacity, so energy recovery must be limited.",
            "Recuperation starts when the driver takes their foot off the accelerator pedal, i.e. in overrun mode without touching the brake pedal. This charges the battery and creates braking torque. This in turn saves strain on the wheel brakes: depending on the recuperation level and traffic situation, they do not have to be operated at all. Another advantage of regeneration: on steep descents, the system works like an engine brake and feeds energy into the battery. The driver can select four different levels of recuperation, using the right-hand AMG steering wheel button. With the exception of \"Slippery\", this applies in all driving modes as well as in \"ESP Sport Handling\" or \"ESP Off\", and the energy recovery is configured differently depending on the driving mode.",
            "Operating strategy: electric power always available",
            "The basic operating strategy is derived from the hybrid powerpack of the Mercedes-AMG Petronas Formula 1 racing car. As in the top class of motorsport, maximum propulsion is always available when the driver calls it up by kick-down - to accelerate powerfully out of corners or to overtake quickly. The electric power can always be called on and frequently reproduced via high recuperation performance and needs-based recharging. The car's specific battery concept allows the optimal compromise between maximum driving dynamics and contemporary efficiency. All components are intelligently coordinated with each other: the performance gain can be experienced directly.",
            "Seven AMG driving modes",
            "The seven AMG DYNAMIC SELECT driving modes \"Electric\", \"Comfort\", \"Battery Hold\", \"Sport\", \"Sport+\", \"Slippery\" and \"Individual\" are precisely tailored to the new drive technology. They thus offer a wide-ranging driving experience - from efficient to dynamic. The driving modes adjust important parameters: the response of the drive and transmission, the steering characteristic, the chassis damping or the sound. The boost power of the electric motor also depends on the respective driving mode. It can be selected via the display in the centre console or the AMG steering wheel buttons. However, one thing is the same in all modes: the peak power of the electric motor can be easily called up via the kick-down function. The haptic accelerator pedal provides a tangible pressure point that the driver's foot must overcome.",
            "As standard, the performance hybrid starts silently (\"Silent Mode\") in the \"Comfort\" driving mode (USA: \"Electric\") when the electric motor is switched on. In the instrument cluster, the \"Ready\" icon signals that the vehicle is ready to drive. In addition, a powerful, sonorous start-up sound characteristic of AMG is emitted in the interior via the vehicle's loudspeakers as acoustic feedback showing readiness to get going. Slight pressure on the accelerator pedal is all it takes to set the AMG Performance hybrid in motion.",
            "Dynamic control combines agility with stability",
            "The integrated AMG DYNAMICS dynamic control system is also part of the standard specification. It influences the control strategies of ESP® (Electronic Stability Program), the all-wheel drive, and the electronically controlled limited-slip rear differential. This increases agility without compromising the vehicle's stability. Particularly noteworthy: AMG DYNAMICS determines how the vehicle should react. The system uses the available sensors, among other things, to ascertain the speed, lateral acceleration, steering angle and yaw rate. By means of intelligent pre-control, the vehicle behaviour can be predicted from the actions of the driver and the data from the sensors. Regulation is tailored to the dynamic driving skill of the driver - without any noticeable or disruptive interventions by the system. The result is an authentic driving experience with high cornering dynamics and optimum traction with high stability and predictable handling. Even experienced drivers are optimally supported without being patronised by the system.",
            "In the \"Individual\" driving mode, the driver can personally set the AMG DYNAMICS levels \"Basic\", \"Advanced\" and \"Pro\".",
            "Interior sound experience during electric driving",
            "When driving on all-electric power, the legally required Acoustic Vehicle Alerting System warns the surroundings that the performance hybrid is approaching. A specially composed, low-frequency and speed-modulated AMG sound is emitted. This is radiated to the outside via loudspeakers. The sound can also be heard at a subdued level in the interior, as acoustic feedback for the passengers. In the European Union the system is active up to 20 km/h, in the USA up to the equivalent of approx. 30 km/h. Afterwards, the electric drive signal fades out harmoniously. Anyone who so wishes can also experience the electric driving sound at higher speed ranges. All they need to do is to select the sound via the corresponding button on the steering wheel (identifiable by the frequency wave symbol).",
            "Confident powerpack: AMG 4.0-litre V8 biturbo engine",
            "A central component of the P3 hybrid powertrain is the AMG 4.0 V8 biturbo engine, in this case producing 450 kW (612 hp). It provides a maximum torque of 900 Nm, which is available over a wide speed range. The engine's most important design features include the two twin-scroll turbochargers, which are located in the hot inner-V. The position between the two cylinder banks shortens the paths of the exhaust gases to the turbocharger and the compressed fresh air to the combustion chamber. The result is a very immediate response. Another important feature is the belt-driven starter-generator (RSG), which is integrated into the 400-volt electrical system. This combines the starter and alternator into one unit, and has sufficient power to always start the V8 at once.",
            "Active engine mounts for the first time in the S-Class",
            "The S63 E PERFORMANCE is the only model in the market segment to be equipped with active engine mounts. The bearings resolve the conflict between soft connection of the powertrain for high comfort and hard connection for optimal driving dynamics: They can infinitely adjust their stiffness to the current driving conditions. The vehicle sensors detect the respective driving situation as well as the resulting vibration behaviour of the engine, and pass this information on to a control unit. This controls the force with which the engine is coupled to the body. The biggest advantage is the further increased spread between performance and comfort.",
            "Short shift times, high efficiency: the AMG SPEEDSHIFT MCT 9G transmission",
            "In the AMG SPEEDSHIFT MCT 9G transmission (MCT = Multi-Clutch Transmission), a wet starting clutch replaces the torque converter. It reduces weight and, thanks to its lower inertia, optimises response to accelerator pedal input, especially during spurts and load changes. The elaborately tuned software ensures short gearshift times as well as fast multiple downshifts if required. It delivers a particularly emotive gearshift experience thanks to the double-declutching function in the \"Sport\" and \"Sport+\" driving modes. Defined ignition interventions allow the gear to be changed even faster than in the other modes. In all drive programs, moving off occurs in first gear in order to always guarantee a dynamic driving experience. There is also the RACE START function, which ensures optimal acceleration from a standstill. In manual mode \"M\", the transmission responds immediately and precisely to manual gearshift commands from the driver, and implements the commands with lightning speed.",
            "Fully variable all-wheel drive AMG Performance 4MATIC+",
            "AMG Performance 4MATIC+ all-wheel drive combines the advantages of different drive concepts: The fully variable torque distribution to the front and rear axles ensures optimum traction at the physical limit. Drivers can rely on high driving stability and safety in all conditions: in the dry, in the wet or on snow. The transition from rear-wheel to all-wheel drive and vice versa takes place continuously on the basis of a sophisticated matrix that integrates the intelligent control into the entire vehicle systems architecture.",
            "An electromechanically controlled clutch connects the permanently driven rear axle variably to the front axle. The best possible torque split is continuously computed according to the driving conditions and driver's input. Alongside traction and lateral dynamics, the all-wheel drive also improves the longitudinal dynamics for even more powerful acceleration.",
            "High torsional rigidity: extensively reinforced bodyshell",
            "The basis for the high driving dynamics and outstanding comfort is the stable bodyshell of the AMG S-Class. At the front, there is an aluminium stabiliser under the V8 biturbo engine. It increases the torsional stiffness of the front end and thus improves feedback to the driver - especially when turning into bends. A cross-brace at the suspension mounting points also stiffens the bodyshell structure.",
            "At the rear, there are diagonal struts made of strong, lightweight aluminium in the underbody to noticeably increase driving precision. A specific load compartment recess made of lightweight fibre-reinforced plastic (FRP) accommodates the AMG high-performance battery and at the same time increases the rigidity of the bodyshell in this area.",
            "AMG RIDE CONTROL+ suspension with adaptive damping as standard",
            "The AMG RIDE CONTROL+ suspension is based on air suspension with automatic level control, combined with adaptive adjustable damping. The air suspension struts are filled with air according to the situation, and thus allow a softer or harder set-up. Another feature is the level control system, which automatically lowers the S-Class by 10 millimetres at above 120 km/h.",
            "With the help of two continuously variable control valves, the damping force can be adjusted very precisely to different driving conditions and driving modes: one valve controls the rebound damping, i.e. the force that occurs when the wheel rebounds, and the other controls the compression damping when the wheel compresses. The rebound and compression phases are controlled independently of each other. The AMG development team was able to significantly increase the spread between sportiness and comfort, among other things by widening the gap between the minimum and maximum damping force characteristics and by providing even greater characteristic mapping flexibility. Thanks to the special design of the valves, the damper reacts quickly and sensitively to changing road surfaces and driving conditions.",
            "The driver can preselect the basic set-up via the AMG DYNAMIC SELECT driving modes: at the touch of a button, the handling characteristics change, for example, from full dynamics in \"Sport+\" mode to smooth cruising in the \"Comfort\" setting. In addition, the tuning can be adjusted independently of the driving modes in three stages (\"Comfort\", \"Sport\" and \"Sport+\") via a dedicated button. The system's control software continuously monitors operating data such as steering wheel angle, vehicle speed, acceleration and body movement. In this way, the dampers are controlled within milliseconds as the situation requires. The result is that, even during extreme driving manoeuvres or on poor roads, the wheels are always firmly on the ground. There is a choice of three different damper characteristics.",
            "Active roll stabilisation as standard",
            "Another feature makes a decisive contribution to the AMG-specific set-up for high driving dynamics: AMG ACTIVE RIDE CONTROL active roll stabilisation. Instead of using conventional, rigid anti-roll bars, the system compensates body movements electromechanically. For this purpose, the anti-roll bars on the front and rear axles are divided into two parts. In the centre is an electromechanical actuator in which a three-stage planetary gear is integrated. When the road surface is uneven or the driving style is moderate, the actuator actively separates the stabiliser halves, which increases driving comfort. During dynamic use, for example on a winding road, the halves join together and are twisted against each other.",
            "Moreover, the system not only reduces rolling movements when cornering, but also allows more precise tuning of the steering and load cycle behaviour. In addition, it increases ride comfort when driving in a straight line because stimuli by one-sided road bumps are balanced out, for example. Movements in the body can be actively and optimally adjusted to the driving conditions. This allows the driver to experience the AMG typical driving characteristics in terms of dynamics, precision and feedback even more intensively.",
            "To meet the high power requirements, the system is based on an additional 48-volt onboard sub-network. Another benefit compared with the usual hydraulic-based systems is the significantly faster response. The AMG control system can adjust the vehicle status up to 500 times per second. Added to this is the lower weight of the components compared to hydraulic solutions.",
            "Performance hybrid drive can control the traction of one wheel instead of ESP",
            "The control of vehicle dynamics also benefits from the hybrid drive. Instead of motors intervention by ESP®, the electric motor can also control traction as soon as a wheel signals too much slip. To do this, the intelligent control system reduces the drive torque of the electric motor that is transferred to the wheel via the limited-slip rear differential. The result is that ESP® does not have to throttle the combustion engine, or only later. Advantage: The combustion engine can thus be operated at a higher torque. This subsequently improves agility. In addition, the otherwise reduced power can be used to charge the battery.",
            "Three-stage AMG parameter steering and standard rear-axle steering",
            "The steering layout also contributes to the increase in dynamics and comfort. The three-stage AMG parameter steering system, for example, features a variable steering geometry ratio that adapts to the selected driving mode. At high speeds, the steering power assistance decreases; at low speeds it is steadily increased. As a result, only a comparatively small amount of force is required at low speeds as well as when manoeuvring and parking. When driving faster, the best possible control of the vehicle is maintained. In the \"Sport\" and \"Sport+\" suspension settings, the steering wheel also provides significantly more feedback about the driving status.",
            "The standard rear-axle steering operates with a maximum steering angle of 2.5 degrees. Up to this point, the rear wheels turn in the opposite direction to the front wheels at speeds of up to 100 km/h (variable depending on the AMG DYNAMICS setting). This leads to a virtual shortening of the wheelbase and results in significantly more agile turn-in, less steering effort and increased manoeuvrability. This noticeably reduces the turning circle when turning or parking. At speeds of more than 100 km/h (variable depending on the AMG DYNAMICS setting), the rear wheels turn in parallel with the front wheels. The virtual extension of the wheelbase has a positive effect on driving stability: It builds up lateral force more quickly when changing direction, allowing the vehicle to respond more directly to steering commands. The response of the rear-axle steering depends on the selected AMG DYNAMIC SELECT driving mode.",
            "The interplay of active roll stabilisation and active rear-axle steering helps to spread the driving behaviour even further. On the one hand, the AMG S-Class is a comfortable touring saloon with absolutely stable handling at high speed. On the other, the driver can call up sporty characteristics with agile light-footedness and manoeuvrability at the touch of a button.",
            "Good control and fade-resistant: the AMG high-performance compound brake system",
            "In keeping with the extreme power and associated performance, the AMG high-performance composite braking system with 6-piston fixed callipers at the front and 1-piston floating callipers at the rear is used as standard. The brake discs at the front axle measure 400 x 38 millimetres, at the rear axle 380 x 32 millimetres. The brake system impresses with very short braking distances as well as maximum stability and fade-resistance under heavy use. In addition, it scores with a long service life and a particularly fast response. Comfort features include Hill Start Assist and priming/dry braking in wet conditions. With the ignition switched off and the vehicle at a standstill, the transmission automatically selects the parking position \"P\". Meanwhile, the electric parking brake releases automatically when pulling away. The AMG ceramic high-performance composite brake system is available as an option. The lightweight brake material saves weight and reduces unsprung masses.",
            "More comfortable and safe driving with numerous assistance systems",
            "Numerous new or enhanced driving assistance systems support the driver. They take the strain out of everyday life by providing situation-specific assistance with speed adaptation, distance control, steering and lane changes. Drivers can stay fit longer and reach their destination more safely and comfortably. In the event of danger, i.e. if an accident is imminent due to carelessness, for example, driving assistance systems can react to the danger depending on the situation and thus reduce the severity of possible collisions or even avoid them altogether.",
            "The new assistance display in the driver display clearly shows the operating principle of the driving assistance systems as a full-screen view. Drivers recognise their car, lanes, lane markings and other road users such as cars, trucks and two-wheelers in an abstracted view. The system status and operation of the assistants are visualised in this depiction of the surroundings. The new, animated assistance display is based on a 3D scene generated in real time. This dynamic, high-quality representation makes the operation of the driving assistance systems transparent as an augmented reality driving experience.",
            "Active Distance Assist DISTRONIC",
            "On all types of roads - motorways, country roads or in town - this intelligent system can automatically maintain a preset distance from vehicles ahead.",
            "Active Steering Assist",
            "This helps drivers to follow their lane in the speed range up to 210 km/h.",
            "Traffic Sign Assist",
            "In addition to conventionally signposted speed limits, this recognises overhead gantries and signs at roadworks.",
            "Active Lane Keeping Assist",
            "In the range from 60 to 250 km/h, Active Lane Keeping Assist uses a camera to detect when lanes markings or edges of roads are crossed, helping the driver to avoid leaving the lane unintentionally. The system also intervenes if there is a danger of collision with detected road users in the adjacent lane, e.g. with overtaking or oncoming vehicles.",
            "Active Lane Change Assist",
            "Active Lane Change Assist cooperatively assists the driver of the new S-Class when moving to an adjacent lane. A lane change to the right or left is only assisted if the sensors detect that the adjacent lane is separated from the present lane by broken lane markings, and no other vehicles are detected in the relevant danger zone.",
            "Active Emergency Stop Assist",

            "Power from the dual electric motors is transferred to the road by the standard-fit AMG Performance 4MATIC+ fully variable all-wheel drive. The system continuously distributes drive torque between the front and rear axles depending on the driving situation. Torque is checked 160 times per second and adjusted if necessary. The torque distribution depends on the selected drive program. In the \"Comfort\" program the focus is on maximum efficiency, while in \"Sport\" and \"Sport+\" torque is more rear-biased for greater lateral dynamics.",
            "AMG RIDE CONTROL+ suspension with Adaptive Damping System",
            "AMG RIDE CONTROL+ with air suspension and an Adaptive Damping System is based on a four-link front axle suspension and a multi-link rear suspension, each optimized with AMG-specific wheel carriers, suspension links, and anti-roll bars with greater rigidity. The rear axle carrier is connected to the bodyshell with 50 percent stiffer bearings and reduced bearing clearance to create even more direct road contact. The AMG development team has specifically tuned all components to meet the special requirements of AMG customers, including ride comfort and driving dynamics.",
            "The Adaptive Damping System uses two pressure limiting valves. These continuously-variable control valves located outside the damper allow the damping force to be adjusted even more precisely to different driving conditions and drive programs. One valve controls the rebound phase, i.e. the force generated when the wheel rebounds, and the other controls the compression phase when the wheel compresses. The rebound and compression phases are controlled independently of each other. This technology makes it possible to increase comfort while also enhancing driving dynamics.",
            "The suspension control unit analyzes data - including from acceleration and wheel path sensors - to adjust the damping force for each wheel in a few milliseconds to best suit the situation. The AMG development team was able to significantly increase the spread between sportiness and comfort, among other things, by widening the spread between minimum and maximum damping force characteristics, as well as even greater flexibility in characteristic mapping. By using the two adjustment valves, the damper is able to provide damping force adjustment across the full range of wheel vibrations. Thanks to the special valve design, the damper reacts quickly and sensitively to changing road surfaces and driving conditions.",
            "Intelligent driving level control enables better aerodynamics and lower power consumption. In the S and S+ drive programs, the Mercedes-AMG EQE SUV adopts the low suspension level from 0 mph (-0.6 in).

Available for both 21- and 22-inch wheels, the tires feature low rolling resistance combined with exceptional levels of grip on wet and dry roads.",
            "Standard-fit active rear-axle steering",
            "The Mercedes-AMG EQE SUV is equipped with active rear-axle steering as standard. The steering angle of up to 9.0 degrees enhances handling and allows a turning radius of 35.8 ft. The interaction between front-axle and rear-axle steering is designed to achieve agile response with little steering effort. At speeds below 37 mph, the rear wheels steer in the opposite direction to the front wheels. As a result, the AMG EQE SUV is agile, light-footed and nimble. The effect is particularly positive when making a turn, changing direction quickly, or during low speed maneuvers. At speeds above 37 mph, the rear wheels steer in the same direction as the front wheels. The resulting virtually extended wheelbase offers increased handling stability and driving safety at highway speeds as well as during fast lane changes or sudden evasive maneuvers.",
            "AMG ACTIVE RIDE CONTROL: electromechanical active roll stabilization",
            "In place of conventional anti-roll bars, the active roll stabilization in the AMG EQE SUV compensates body movements electromechanically. For this purpose, the anti-roll bars on the front and rear axles are divided into two parts. In the center is an electromechanical actuator integrated with a three-stage planetary gear. If the road surface is uneven, the actuator actively separates the stabilizer halves, which increases ride comfort. During dynamic driving, the halves join together and are twisted against each other. This significantly reduces rolling movements. In order to meet the high performance requirements of Mercedes-AMG, the system is based on an additional 48-volt auxiliary power system. The AMG development team redesigned the rear section of the vehicle to accommodate the roll stabilization system.",
            "Advantages of the electromechanical roll stabilization include:",
            "For an individual driving experience: AMG DYNAMIC SELECT drive programs",

The i-Booster is specially tuned for the AMG brake system to deliver an authentic driving experience.",
            "AMG SOUND EXPERIENCE: unique sound experience with a wide bandwidth",
            "With AMG SOUND EXPERIENCE, the performance and sports car brand is giving a new voice to electric mobility - a soundtrack for inside and out that emotionally enhances the dynamic driving experience. Like the drive programs, the acoustic composition has a wide bandwidth. In the standard basic version \"Authentic,\" the customer can regulate the sound and its intensity depending on the driving status and selected drive program. The hallmark AMG driving sounds are generated with the help of additional hardware, including special speakers, a bass actuator, and a sound generator. Another option for even more individuality: using the AMG steering wheel buttons or the central display, the driver can select the sound characteristics \"Balanced,\" \"Sport\" and \"Powerful\" in each drive program. During RACE START, the vehicle produces a unique sound to match the dynamic acceleration.",
            "In addition to the drive sounds, the AMG SOUND EXPERIENCE also features event sounds - suitable sounds for all vehicle functions that emit a sound. This includes starting and stopping the motor, charging or infotainment functions and even the simulated click of direction indicators. Another unique feature is the AMG-specific event sound that is heard when the vehicle is locked. The event sounds can be deactivated at any time via the multimedia system settings - separately for the exterior and interior.",
            "AMG DYNAMIC PLUS Package with dynamic driving extras",
            "The optional AMG DYNAMIC PLUS package combines extra dynamic features - including the powerful boost for RACE START, an increase in maximum speed to 149 mph and the AMG SOUND EXPERIENCE \"Performance,\" which creates an even more emotional soundscape.",
            "The driving dynamics deliver what the sound promises. If the temperature and state of charge are suitable, the maximum power and torque for RACE START can be briefly increased. The AMG EQE SUV then takes just an estimated 3.4 seconds to sprint from 0 to 60 mph. The onboard bass actuator and speakers make the power of the electric motors known, even when stationary, and provide an emotionally charged sound backdrop to the rapid acceleration. The AMG-specific graphics in the displays also visually underscore the driving performance.",
            "Further options for an even more dynamic AMG experience",
            "Optional design features such as the AMG Night package and AMG Night Package Plus with elements in black and black chrome, or the AMG Carbon Fiber interior trim, can enhance the dynamic AMG look. The choice of the AMG ceramic high-performance composite brake system and aerodynamically optimized 20- and 21-inch AMG light-alloy wheels can further contribute to refined driving dynamics.",
            "AMG TRACK PACE, a virtual race engineer, is also available as an option: the software is part of the MBUX infotainment system and permanently records more than 80 vehicle-specific data (i.e. speed and acceleration). For example while driving on a race track, lap and sector times are displayed, as well as the respective difference from a reference time. Drivers are able to see at a glance whether they are currently faster or slower than the best time. Green or red display elements are shown on the multimedia display, in the instrument cluster and on the optional head-up display.",
            "High-performance drive battery with a capacity of 90.6 kWh",

            "Short charging times through intelligent thermal management",
            "Another advantage of the new generation battery is quick charging times. The energy storage system can charge with up to 170 kW at fast charging stations with direct current. In this case, electricity for approximately 100 miles (170 kilometers, WLTP) can be recharged in just 15 minutes1. With the on-board charger, the AMG EQE SUV can be conveniently charged at home or at public charging stations with alternating current. In addition, there are intelligent charging programs that can be activated automatically depending on the location. Functions such as battery-saving charging make operations even more efficient.",
            "The efficient thermal management also plays a part in quicker charging times. If the intelligent navigation with Electric Intelligence is activated, the battery is preheated or cooled while driving to reach the optimal temperature for faster charging at the charging point. The desired temperature range of the battery is achieved with the aid of the cooling circuit and a PTC (Positive Temperature Coefficient) booster heater integrated into it.",
            "The battery design aims to ensure the optimum battery operating temperature under all operating conditions. The aluminum extrusions of the battery frame have defined cavities through which the coolant flows. The intelligent temperature and charging management ensures that high charging currents can be maintained for a long time. The standard heat pump uses the waste heat from the electric drive (inverter and electric motor) and the high-voltage battery to heat the interior. This reduces the need to use battery power for interior heating, and thus increases range. Another function is pre-entry climate control.",
            "The battery also stands out for its durability. The ECO Charging function makes a significant contribution to this: the intelligent control reduces the battery load during charging, and thus slows down the natural aging process of the battery. Customers can also benefit from the \"charging interruption\" function, which enables the charging process to be paused at freely selectable times to prioritize charging during off-peak times.",

The app now also shows how busy the respective charging station is likely to be during the course of the day, based on a probability calculation.",
            "Predictive route planning and efficient driving with Electric Intelligence",
            "When it comes to Navigation with Electric Intelligence, the name says it all. The system plans the fastest and most convenient route, including charging stops, based on numerous factors and reacts dynamically to traffic events as well as changes in driving style. It also takes into account topography, route, ambient temperature, driving speed and heating and cooling requirements.",
            "For its calculations the system uses information from the cloud, which it combines with onboard data. The planned route can be edited individually. For example, the customer can set the additional reserve at the destination and at the charging station - ten percent state of charge (SoC) is standard. If the \"Charge at destination\" function is selected, the set reserve may be undercut until the destination is reached. MBUX indicates whether the available battery capacity is sufficient to reach the destination without charging.",
            "Further options for individual route planning include:",
            "If there is a risk of not reaching the destination or the charging station with the selected settings, Active Range Monitoring issues the prompt to activate ECO driving functions.",
            "Comprehensive safety concept: Battery is crash-protected in the underbody",
            "The battery sits in a crash-protected area in the underbody, embedded in the bodyshell structure and includes an extruded aluminum profile to the side. During extrusion, a heated block of metal is pushed through the dies and turns into an endless section, which is then cut to fit. This makes highly complex profiles that are precisely tailored to the requirements possible. The housing with energy absorbing structures at the front and side, as well as a rigid, double-walled base plate, provide additional protection for the modules. In addition, there is a separate, multi-level safety system for everyday operation. This includes, for example, temperature, voltage or insulation monitoring. If a fault occurs, the battery switches off. Crash monitoring when stationary is also standard."

            "A centrally positioned radiator was first used by Porsche in the Le Mans class-winning 911 RSR and subsequently in the 911 GT3 R. Now, it is featured in a road-going 911 model for the first time.",
            "Instead of the three-radiator layout seen in previous 911 models, the new 911 GT3 RS relies on a large, angled centre radiator in the car's nose, positioned where the luggage compartment is located on other 911 models. This has made it possible to use the space freed up on the sides to integrate active aerodynamic elements. These continuously adjustable wing elements - in combination with the two-part rear wing and a number of other aerodynamic measures - provide 409 kg of total downforce at 124 mph (200 km/h). It means that the new 911 GT3 RS generates twice as much downforce as its 991.2-generation predecessor and three times as much as a current 911 GT3. At 177 mph (285 km/h), total downforce is 860 kg.",
            "The look of the new Porsche 911 GT3 RS is characterised by the large number of functional aerodynamic elements. The most prominent feature of the GT3 RS is the 'swan-neck' rear wing, which is significantly larger in all dimensions than any wing previously used on a road-going 911. It consists of a fixed main wing and an upper, hydraulically adjustable wing element. For the first time on a Porsche production vehicle, the upper edge of the rear wing extends higher than the roof.",
            "In addition, the front end of the 911 GT3 RS no longer has a front spoiler, but instead features a front splitter that divides the air flowing over and underneath. Sideblades accurately direct air outwards, while front wheel arch ventilation is provided via louvred openings in the front wings. Inlets behind the front wheels, in the style of the iconic Le Mans-winning 911 GT1, reduce the dynamic pressure in the wheel arches. Sideblades behind the intake ensure that the air is directed to the side of the vehicle. Air from the centrally positioned radiator flows out via large nostrils on the bonnet, while fins on the roof direct the air outwards, ensuring cooler intake temperatures in the rear. The openings in the rear side panel are used purely to improve aerodynamics and not to draw in engine intake air. The rear wheel arch also features an intake and a sideblade for optimised airflow, while the rear diffuser is an enhanced version of the one used on the 911 GT3.",
            "Another first for a production Porsche model is the fitment of a drag reduction system (DRS). To achieve low drag and therefore higher straight-line speeds, the DRS allows the wings to be flattened out at the push of a button. There is also an airbrake function, activated during emergency braking at high speeds: the wing elements at the front and rear are set to their maximum angle, creating aerodynamic drag that works in combination with the brakes to improve overall deceleration.",
            "Track suspension that can be adjusted from the cockpit",
            "Aerodynamic enhancements even include the suspension components. Because the wheel arches of the new Porsche 911 GT3 RS are subject to powerful airflows, the front double-wishbone arms have been designed with teardrop-shaped profiles. These aerodynamically efficient links, normally only used in high-end motorsport applications, increase downforce on the front axle by around 40 kg at top speed. Because of the wider track (29 millimetres wider than the 911 GT3), the front axle arms are also correspondingly longer.",
            "To maintain downforce balance between the front and rear axles when braking from high speeds, pitching under braking has been significantly reduced. To achieve this, the front ball joint of the lower trailing arm has been set lower on the front axle. The multi-link rear axle has also been adjusted, with modified spring rates. Working in harmony with these changes, the driver assistance systems and rear-axle steering have an even more dynamic setup.",
            "The Porsche 911 GT3 RS offers three driving modes: Normal, Sport and Track. In Track mode, the basic settings can be individually adjusted. This includes the rebound and compression damping for the front and rear axles, which be adjusted separately and in several stages. The differential can also be adjusted, using rotary controls on the steering wheel. This is done quickly and intuitively with an operating and display concept borrowed from motorsport: four individual rotary controls and a button for the DRS are located on the steering wheel. These rotary controls are displayed with graphics in the instrument cluster during the adjustment process. The 911 GT3 RS also features the track screen already familiar from the 911 GT3: at the touch of a button, the driver can reduce the digital displays on the two seven-inch side displays to essential information only. The gearshift indicators to the left and right of the analogue tachometer have also been taken from the GT3.",
            "High-revving, four-litre six-cylinder boxer engine",
            "The 4.0-litre high-revving naturally aspirated engine has been further optimised compared with the engine in the 911 GT3. The increase in power to 525 PS (386 kW) is achieved primarily by using a new camshaft design with modified cam profiles. Its single-throttle intake system and the rigid valve drive are derived from motorsport. The seven-speed Porsche Doppelkupplung (PDK) has a shorter final drive ratio than the 911 GT3, further improving acceleration, while air intakes on the underbody ensure that the transmission can withstand extreme loads during frequent track use. The Porsche 911 GT3 RS accelerates from zero to 62 mph (100 km/h) in 3.2 seconds and reaches a top speed of 184 mph (296 km/h) in seventh gear. Combined fuel economy is 21.1 mpg, equivalent to 305 g/km CO2 (WLTP).",
            "The front axle features six-piston aluminium monobloc fixed-position calipers with 408 mm diameter discs. Compared to the 911 GT3, the piston diameters have been increased from 30 to 32 mm, while disc thickness has been increased from 34 to 36 mm. The rear axle continues to be fitted with 380 mm brake discs and four-piston fixed calipers. Porsche Ceramic Composite Brakes (PCCB) are available as an option, and feature 410 mm discs on the front axle and 390 mm discs on the rear axle. The new 911 GT3 RS comes standard with forged light-alloy centre-lock wheels, fitted with 275/35 R 20 front and 335/30 R21 rear tyres, ensuring a high level of mechanical grip.",
            "Lightweight construction all the way",
            "Intelligent lightweight construction has been a basic principle of all RS models ever since the legendary 911 Carrera RS 2.7. Thanks to an array of lightweight construction measures such as the extensive use of carbon fibre reinforced plastic (CFRP), the 911 GT3 RS weighs in at only 1,450 kg (DIN kerb weight: vehicle including 90% fuel and all fluids). The doors, front wings, roof and bonnet, for example, are made from CFRP, and this material is also used in the interior, for example in the standard full bucket seats.",
            "Available with Clubsport and Weissach packages",
            "The interior of the GT3 RS is finished in typical RS style: black leather, Race-Tex and carbon-weave finish characterise the pure, race-derived ambience. The 911 GT3 RS is available with the Clubsport package at no extra cost, which includes a steel rollover bar, a handheld fire extinguisher, and six-point seatbelts for the driver.",
            "The Weissach package features a carbon-weave finish to the bonnet, roof, parts of the rear wing and the upper shell of the exterior mirrors. The front and rear anti-roll bars, the rear coupling rods and the shear panel on the rear axle are made of CFRP and contribute to a further enhancement of the driving dynamics. The rollover bar, constructed from CFRP for the first time, saves around six kilograms compared with the steel version. Another highlight of the Weissach package is the PDK shift paddles with motorsport-derived magnet technology, which make gear changes even more tactile thanks to a more precise pressure point and a clearly perceptible click. A further option available with the Weissach package is magnesium forged wheels, which save another eight kilograms. The Weissach pack costs £25,739, or £22,515 without the rollover bar.",

            "At the heart of the new Mercedes-AMG GLC models is the AMG 2.0-litre four-cylinder engine, which combines innovative technologies and high performance with exemplary efficiency. The power unit remains true to a tradition typical of the brand: Not only was it developed entirely at the company's Affalterbach site, but it is also installed there in accordance with the \"One Man, One Engine\" principle. In doing so, Mercedes-AMG combines the craftsmanship of its highly qualified employees with the latest production methods of Industry 4.0 and a high degree of digitalisation.",
            "The M139l engine, as it is known internally (l for longitudinal installation), is the only production engine in the world to date that is turbocharged with an electric exhaust gas turbocharger. The system is a direct derivative of the technology that the Mercedes-AMG Petronas F1™ Team has been using successfully in the premier class of motorsport for many years. The new form of turbocharging guarantees particularly spontaneous response across the entire rev range. This leads to an even more dynamic driving experience, while at the same time increasing efficiency.",
            "The functional principle of the electric exhaust gas turbocharger in detail",
            "An electric motor around four centimetres thin is integrated directly on the turbocharger shaft between the turbine wheel on the exhaust side and the compressor wheel on the intake side. This directly drives the shaft of the turbocharger and is electronically controlled, accelerating the compressor wheel before the exhaust gas flow takes over the drive conventionally.",
            "This significantly improves the response directly from idle speed and across the entire rev range. The combustion engine responds even more spontaneously to accelerator pedal input, while the entire driving feel is significantly more dynamic. In addition, the electrification of the turbocharger allows higher torque at low revs. This also increases agility and optimises acceleration from a standstill. Even when the driver lifts off the accelerator or brakes, the technology is able to maintain boost pressure at all times. This ensures a continuously direct response.",
            "Powered by the 48-volt on-board electrical system, the electric exhaust gas turbocharger operates at speeds of up to 175,000 rpm, which enables a very high air flow rate. The turbocharger, electric motor and power electronics are connected to the combustion engine's cooling circuit to create an optimal temperature environment at all times.",
            "Compared to the GLC43, however, the turbocharger in the GLC63 S is significantly larger. This delivers a higher air flow rate and thus more power. In addition, the integrated electric motor is driven by the 400-volt high-voltage system.",
            "The closed deck design of the M139l ensures high rigidity at low weight. This enables peak combustion pressures of up to 160 bar. The areas around the cylinders are largely closed, and the cover plate is only pierced by smaller channels for the coolant and engine oil. Another outstanding feature of the engine is the two-stage petrol injection. In the first stage, particularly fast and precise piezo injectors deliver the fuel into the combustion chambers at pressures of up to 200 bar. The second stage adds intake manifold duct injection with solenoid valves, which is needed to achieve the engine's high specific power output.",
            "310 kW (421 hp) output and 500 Nm torque enable sporty driving performance",
            "In the 2.0-litre four-cylinder in-line engine, the innovative technology helps the Mercedes-AMG GLC43 4MATIC to achieve a rated output of 310 kW (421 hp) at 6750 rpm. The maximum torque of 500 Nm is available at 5000 rpm. Depending on the situation, the system also briefly provides an additional boost of 10 kW (14 hp) by the belt-driven starter generator (BSG). The second-generation RSG acts as a mild hybrid, providing this temporary power boost as well as functions such as gliding and recuperation for maximum efficiency. At the same time, the 48-volt technology also increases comfort, as the transitions between the start/stop function and the gliding mode function are almost imperceptible. The GLC43 4MATIC accelerates from a standstill to 100 km/h in 4.8 seconds. The top speed is electronically limited to 250 km/h.",
            "E PERFORMANCE Hybrid with 500 kW (680 hp) system output and up to 1020 Nm system torque",
            "In the GLC63 S E PERFORMANCE, the M139l produces 350 kW (476 hp) at 6725 rpm. This makes it the most powerful series-produced four-cylinder engine in the world. The maximum combustion engine torque of 545 Nm is available at 5250-5500 rpm. In the performance hybrid, the 2.0-litre engine is combined with a permanently excited synchronous electric motor, a high-performance battery developed in Affalterbach and the fully variable AMG Performance 4MATIC+ all-wheel-drive system. The system output of 500 kW (680 hp) and the maximum system torque of 1020 Nm enable impressive driving performance: Acceleration from standstill to 100 km/h takes just 3.5 seconds and only ends at an electronically governed 275 km/h.",
            "The 150 kW (204 hp) electric motor is positioned at the rear axle, where it is integrated with an electrically shifted two-speed transmission and the electronically controlled limited-slip rear differential in a compact electric drive unit (EDU). Experts refer to this layout as a P3 hybrid. The lightweight high-performance battery is also located in the rear above the rear axle. This compact design has numerous advantages:",
            "The electric motor acts directly on the rear axle and can therefore convert its power more directly into propulsion - for that extra boost when moving off, accelerating or overtaking. The inherent design of the electric motor means that its power can kick in straight away at full torque, making particularly agile starting possible. In addition, the driver immediately experiences a noticeable performance increase thanks to the integrated, electronically controlled limited-slip rear differential: the hybrid model accelerates out of bends with great agility.",
            "If slip occurs at the rear axle, the drive power of the electric motor is also transferred to the front wheels as needed for more traction. The mechanical connection of the fully variable all-wheel drive makes this possible by means of the propeller shaft and drive shafts of the front wheels. The positioning at the rear axle improves the weight and axle load distribution in the vehicle. This forms the basis for the compelling handling.",
            "The AMG concept offers very high recuperation efficiency, as the system allows only minimal mechanical and hydraulic losses from the engine and transmission. The automated two-speed transmission at the rear axle with its specially calibrated gear ratio ensures the spread from high wheel torque for agile starting to safe continuous output at higher speeds. An electric actuator engages second gear at around 140 km/h at the latest, which corresponds to the electric motor's maximum speed of around 13,500 rpm.",
            "With the increase in performance due to the additional electric motor, the development team was also able to improve the efficiency of the entire vehicle in parallel - and achieve lower emissions as well as lower consumption.",
            "Inspired by Formula 1™, developed in Affalterbach: the AMG high-performance battery",
            "The development of the lithium-ion energy storage system is inspired by technologies proven in the Mercedes-AMG Petronas F1 Team's Formula 1™ hybrid racing cars. In the course of the development, the experts from the Formula 1™ engine shop High Performance Powertrains (HPP) in Brixworth exchanged ideas intensively with Mercedes-AMG in Affalterbach. The AMG high-performance battery combines high power that can be called up frequently in succession with low weight to increase the overall performance of the vehicle. Added to this are the fast energy draw and the high power density. This means that during a brisk drive in hilly terrain, for example, drivers can immediately call on the full power potential on uphill stretches, while recuperation is strong when driving downhill.",
            "80 kW continuous output and 150 kW peak output",
            "The high-performance battery in the GLC63 S E PERFORMANCE offers a capacity of 6.1 kWh, 80 kW continuous power and 150 kW peak power for ten seconds. Charging takes place via recuperation or the installed 3.7 kW on-board charger with alternating current at a charging station, wallbox or household socket. The battery is designed for fast power delivery and draw, not for the longest possible range. Nevertheless, the electric range of 12 kilometres allows a practical activity radius, for example for quiet and all-electric driving from the residential area to the outskirts of the city or to the motorway.",
            "The continual push for innovation: direct cooling of the battery cells",
            "The basis for the high performance of the AMG 400-volt battery is its innovative direct cooling system: for the first time, a high-tech coolant based on an electrically non-conductive liquid flows around all 560 cells and cools them individually. Every battery needs a defined temperature for optimum power delivery. If the energy storage unit gets too cold or too hot, it temporarily loses noticeable power or has to be turned down in order not to be damaged if the temperature level is too high. The consistent temperature of the battery therefore has a decisive influence on its performance, service life and safety. The AMG system is designed to ensure even heat distribution in the battery.",
            "The battery is always within a consistent, optimum operating temperature window averaging 45 degrees Celsius, no matter how often it is charged or discharged. It may well be that the average temperature is exceeded when driving at high speeds. The protection mechanisms are therefore set in such a way that the maximum power can be drawn from the battery in order to subsequently lower the temperature level again through direct cooling.",
            "Operating strategy: electric power always available",
            "The basic operating strategy is derived from the hybrid powerpack of the Mercedes-AMG Petronas Formula 1 racing car. As in the top class of motorsport, maximum propulsion is always available when the driver calls it up by kick-down - to accelerate powerfully out of corners or to overtake quickly. The electric power can always be called on and frequently reproduced via high recuperation performance and needs-based recharging.",
            "Performance Hybrid Drive can control the traction of one wheel",
            "The control of vehicle dynamics also benefits from the hybrid drive. Instead of braking intervention by ESP®, the electric motor can also control traction as soon as a wheel signals too much slip. To achieve this, the intelligent control system reduces the drive torque of the electric motor, which is transmitted to the wheel via the limited-slip rear differential. The result is that ESP® does not have to intervene at all, or only later.",
            "Advantage: The combustion engine can thus be operated at a higher torque. This improves agility afterwards and increases efficiency. In addition, the power otherwise \"destroyed\" during braking can be used to charge the battery.",
            "AMG SPEEDSHIFT MCT 9G transmission with wet start-off clutch",
            "The power is transmitted in both Mercedes-AMG GLC models via the AMG SPEEDSHIFT MCT 9G transmission (MCT = Multi-Clutch Transmission), in which a wet start-off clutch replaces the torque converter. It reduces weight and, thanks to its lower inertia, optimises response to accelerator pedal input, especially during spurts and load changes. The elaborately calibrated software ensures extremely short shift times as well as fast multiple downshifts if required. In addition, the double-declutching function in the \"Sport\" and \"Sport+\" drive programs delivers a particularly expressive shifting experience. There is also the RACE START function, which ensures optimal acceleration from a standstill. The ECO start/stop function is automatically activated in the \"Comfort\" drive program; the \"Glide\" function can be activated in \"Individual\" mode.",
            "In the GLC43, the AMG Performance 4MATIC all-wheel drive features a permanent power distribution between the front and rear axles of 31 to 69 percent. The rear-biased configuration provides for enhanced dynamic handling, including higher lateral acceleration and improved traction when accelerating. In the GLC63 S, the AMG Performance 4MATIC+ fully variable all-wheel drive transmits the drive power to the road. The engine torque can be allocated continuously and as required from 50/50 between the front and rear axles up to 100 percent to the rear.",
            "AMG DYNAMICS a standard component of the AMG DYNAMIC SELECT drive program selection",
            "The AMG DYNAMIC SELECT drive programs (five for the GLC43, eight for the GLC63 S) enable a wide range of vehicle characteristics from comfortable to dynamic. The distinct driving modes offer an individual driving experience, precisely tailored to different driving conditions.",
            "The integrated \"AMG DYNAMICS\" driving dynamics control system is added as part of the AMG DYNAMIC SELECT drive programs. This enhances the stabilising functions of the Electronic Stability Program ESP® with interventions to add agility to the steering characteristics and additional ESP® functions. When cornering at speed, for example, brief braking intervention at the inner rear wheel generates a defined yawing moment around the vertical axis for responsive and precise turn-in.",
            "The extent and efficiency of these interventions depend on the AMG DYNAMIC SELECT program selected, whereby the driver can determine the set-up in \"Individual\" model. The ESP® can be adjusted in three stages. \"On\" is the standard selection that offers high safety, adapted to the sporty character of the overall vehicle. \"Sport\", on the other hand, allows higher drift angles, while \"Off\" allows the system to be switched off completely for a particularly sporty driving style on closed-off race tracks.",
            "AMG RIDE CONTROL suspension with Adaptive Damping System",
            "Both models are equipped with the AMG RIDE CONTROL steel spring suspension with Adaptive Damping System. It combines sporty driving dynamics with high long-distance comfort. The basis for this is provided by the front axle, with specially developed steering knuckles and suspension joints on the spring control arm, and by the rear axle, which also features elasto-kinematics designed for driving dynamics. Complementing this, the Adaptive Damping System continuously adapts the damping at each individual wheel to the current demand - always taking into account the preselected suspension level, the driving style and the condition of the road surface. In addition to an improvement in ride quality and comfort, this leads, above all, to an increase in driving safety. There is a choice of three different damping maps (\"Comfort\", \"Sport\" and \"Sport+\").",
            "Active roll stabilisation as standard on the GLC63 S E PERFORMANCE",
            "Another feature makes a decisive contribution to the AMG-specific set-up for high driving dynamics: AMG ACTIVE RIDE CONTROL active roll stabilisation as standard in the GLC63 S E PERFORMANCE. Instead of using conventional, rigid anti-roll bars, the system compensates body movements electromechanically. For this purpose, the anti-roll bars on the front and rear axles are divided into two parts. In the centre is an electromechanical actuator in which a three-stage planetary gear is integrated. When the road surface is uneven or the driving style is moderate, the actuator actively separates the stabiliser halves, which increases driving comfort. During dynamic use, for example on a winding road, the halves join together and are twisted against each other.",
            "Moreover, the system not only reduces rolling movements when cornering, but also allows more precise tuning of the steering and load cycle behaviour. In addition, it increases ride comfort when driving in a straight line because stimuli by one-sided road bumps are balanced out, for example. Movements in the body can be actively and optimally adjusted to the driving conditions. This allows the driver to experience the hallmark AMG driving characteristics in terms of dynamics, precision and feedback even more intensively.",
            "To meet the high power requirements, the system is based on an additional 48-volt on-board sub-network. Another benefit compared with the usual hydraulic-based systems is the significantly faster response. Added to this is the lower weight of the components compared to hydraulic solutions.",
            "Three-stage AMG speed-sensitive steering and standard rear-axle steering",
            "The steering layout of the Mercedes-AMG GLC models contributes equally to the increase in dynamics and comfort. The three-stage AMG speed-sensitive steering system, for example, features a variable steering geometry ratio that adapts to the selected drive program. At high speeds, the steering power assistance decreases; at low speeds it is steadily increased. As a result, comparatively little steering effort is required at low speeds, as well as when manoeuvring and parking, while the best possible control over the vehicle is maintained when driving faster. In the \"Sport\" and \"Sport+\" suspension settings, the driver also experiences significantly more feedback about the driving conditions via the steering wheel.",
            "Active rear-axle steering is also on board as standard. It operates with a maximum steering angle of 2.5°. Up to this point, the rear wheels turn in the opposite direction to the front wheels at speeds of up to 100 km/h (variable depending on the AMG DYNAMICS setting). This leads to a virtual shortening of the wheelbase, which in turn results in significantly more agile turn-in, less steering effort and improved manoeuvrability. For example, the turning circle is noticeably reduced when turning or parking. At speeds above 100 km/h (variable depending on the AMG DYNAMICS setting), on the other hand, the rear wheels turn in parallel to the front wheels - up to a maximum of 0.7°. This virtual extension of the wheelbase has a positive effect on driving stability, leads to a faster build-up of lateral force when changing direction and thus to a more direct reaction of the vehicle to steering commands. The response of the rear-axle steering depends on the selected AMG DYNAMIC SELECT driving mode.",
            "AMG sports braking system and AMG exhaust system with sporty engine sound",
            "The AMG sports brake system in the GLC43 guarantees outstanding deceleration values and optimum control. Internally ventilated and perforated brake discs measuring 370 x 36 millimetres with 4-piston fixed callipers are fitted to the front axle and 360 x 26 millimetres with 1-piston floating callipers to the rear.",
            "In keeping with the extreme power values and the associated performance, the AMG high-performance composite brake system with 6-piston fixed callipers at the front (internally ventilated and perforated brake discs 390 x 36 mm) and 1-piston floating callipers at the rear (internally ventilated and perforated brake discs 370 x 26 mm) comes as standard on the GLC63 S. The brake system impresses with very short braking distances as well as maximum stability and fade-resistance under heavy use. In addition, it scores with a long service life and a particularly fast response.",

The power unit remains true to a tradition typical of the brand: Not only was it developed entirely at the company's Affalterbach site, but it is also installed there in accordance with the \"One Man, One Engine\" principle. In doing so, Mercedes-AMG combines the craftsmanship of its highly qualified employees with the latest production methods of Industry 4.0 and a high degree of digitalisation.",
            "The M139l engine, as it is known internally (l for longitudinal installation), is the only production engine in the world to date that is turbocharged with an electric exhaust gas turbocharger. The system is a direct derivative of the technology that the Mercedes-AMG Petronas F1™ Team has been using successfully in the premier class of motorsport for many years. The new form of turbocharging guarantees particularly spontaneous response across the entire rev range. This leads to an even more dynamic driving experience, while at the same time increasing efficiency.",
            "The functional principle of the electric exhaust gas turbocharger in detail",
            "An electric motor around four centimetres thin is integrated directly on the turbocharger shaft between the turbine wheel on the exhaust side and the compressor wheel on the intake side. This directly drives the shaft of the turbocharger and is electronically controlled, accelerating the compressor wheel before the exhaust gas flow takes over the drive conventionally.",
            "This significantly improves the response directly from idle speed and across the entire rev range. The combustion engine responds even more spontaneously to accelerator pedal input, while the entire driving feel is significantly more dynamic. In addition, the electrification of the turbocharger allows higher torque at low revs. This also increases agility and optimises acceleration from a standstill. Even when the driver lifts off the accelerator or brakes, the technology is able to maintain boost pressure at all times. This ensures a continuously direct response.",
            "Powered by the 48-volt on-board electrical system, the electric exhaust gas turbocharger operates at speeds of up to 175,000 rpm, which enables a very high air flow rate. The turbocharger, electric motor and power electronics are connected to the combustion engine's cooling circuit to create an optimal temperature environment at all times.",
            "Compared to the GLC43, however, the turbocharger in the GLC63 S is significantly larger. This delivers a higher air flow rate and thus more power. In addition, the integrated electric motor is driven by the 400-volt high-voltage system.",
            "The closed deck design of the M139l ensures high rigidity at low weight. This enables peak combustion pressures of up to 160 bar. The areas around the cylinders are largely closed, and the cover plate is only pierced by smaller channels for the coolant and engine oil. Another outstanding feature of the engine is the two-stage petrol injection. In the first stage, particularly fast and precise piezo injectors deliver the fuel into the combustion chambers at pressures of up to 200 bar. The second stage adds intake manifold duct injection with solenoid valves, which is needed to achieve the engine's high specific power output.",

Nevertheless, the electric range of 12 kilometres allows a practical activity radius, for example for quiet and all-electric driving from the residential area to the outskirts of the city or to the motorway.",
            "The continual push for innovation: direct cooling of the battery cells",
            "The basis for the high performance of the AMG 400-volt battery is its innovative direct cooling system: for the first time, a high-tech coolant based on an electrically non-conductive liquid flows around all 560 cells and cools them individually. Every battery needs a defined temperature for optimum power delivery. If the energy storage unit gets too cold or too hot, it temporarily loses noticeable power or has to be turned down in order not to be damaged if the temperature level is too high. The consistent temperature of the battery therefore has a decisive influence on its performance, service life and safety. The AMG system is designed to ensure even heat distribution in the battery.",
            "The battery is always within a consistent, optimum operating temperature window averaging 45 degrees Celsius, no matter how often it is charged or discharged. It may well be that the average temperature is exceeded when driving at high speeds. The protection mechanisms are therefore set in such a way that the maximum power can be drawn from the battery in order to subsequently lower the temperature level again through direct cooling.",
            "Operating strategy: electric power always available",
            "The basic operating strategy is derived from the hybrid powerpack of the Mercedes-AMG Petronas Formula 1 racing car. As in the top class of motorsport, maximum propulsion is always available when the driver calls it up by kick-down - to accelerate powerfully out of corners or to overtake quickly. The electric power can always be called on and frequently reproduced via high recuperation performance and needs-based recharging.",
            "Performance Hybrid Drive can control the traction of one wheel",
            "The control of vehicle dynamics also benefits from the hybrid drive. Instead of braking intervention by ESP®, the electric motor can also control traction as soon as a wheel signals too much slip. To achieve this, the intelligent control system reduces the drive torque of the electric motor, which is transmitted to the wheel via the limited-slip rear differential. The result is that ESP® does not have to intervene at all, or only later.",
            "Advantage: The combustion engine can thus be operated at a higher torque. This improves agility afterwards and increases efficiency. In addition, the power otherwise \"destroyed\" during braking can be used to charge the battery.",
            "AMG SPEEDSHIFT MCT 9G transmission with wet start-off clutch",
            "The power is transmitted in both Mercedes-AMG GLC models via the AMG SPEEDSHIFT MCT 9G transmission (MCT = Multi-Clutch Transmission), in which a wet start-off clutch replaces the torque converter. It reduces weight and, thanks to its lower inertia, optimises response to accelerator pedal input, especially during spurts and load changes. The elaborately calibrated software ensures extremely short shift times as well as fast multiple downshifts if required. In addition, the double-declutching function in the \"Sport\" and \"Sport+\" drive programs delivers a particularly expressive shifting experience. There is also the RACE START function, which ensures optimal acceleration from a standstill. The ECO start/stop function is automatically activated in the \"Comfort\" drive program; the \"Glide\" function can be activated in \"Individual\" mode.",
            "In the GLC43, the AMG Performance 4MATIC all-wheel drive features a permanent power distribution between the front and rear axles of 31 to 69 percent. The rear-biased configuration provides for enhanced dynamic handling, including higher lateral acceleration and improved traction when accelerating. In the GLC63 S, the AMG Performance 4MATIC+ fully variable all-wheel drive transmits the drive power to the road. The engine torque can be allocated continuously and as required from 50/50 between the front and rear axles up to 100 percent to the rear.",
            "AMG DYNAMICS a standard component of the AMG DYNAMIC SELECT drive program selection",
            "The AMG DYNAMIC SELECT drive programs (five for the GLC43, eight for the GLC63 S) enable a wide range of vehicle characteristics from comfortable to dynamic. The distinct driving modes offer an individual driving experience, precisely tailored to different driving conditions.",
            "The integrated \"AMG DYNAMICS\" driving dynamics control system is added as part of the AMG DYNAMIC SELECT drive programs. This enhances the stabilising functions of the Electronic Stability Program ESP® with interventions to add agility to the steering characteristics and additional ESP® functions. When cornering at speed, for example, brief braking intervention at the inner rear wheel generates a defined yawing moment around the vertical axis for responsive and precise turn-in.",
            "The extent and efficiency of these interventions depend on the AMG DYNAMIC SELECT program selected, whereby the driver can determine the set-up in \"Individual\" model. The ESP® can be adjusted in three stages. \"On\" is the standard selection that offers high safety, adapted to the sporty character of the overall vehicle. \"Sport\", on the other hand, allows higher drift angles, while \"Off\" allows the system to be switched off completely for a particularly sporty driving style on closed-off race tracks.",
            "AMG RIDE CONTROL suspension with Adaptive Damping System",
            "Both models are equipped with the AMG RIDE CONTROL steel spring suspension with Adaptive Damping System. It combines sporty driving dynamics with high long-distance comfort. The basis for this is provided by the front axle, with specially developed steering knuckles and suspension joints on the spring control arm, and by the rear axle, which also features elasto-kinematics designed for driving dynamics. Complementing this, the Adaptive Damping System continuously adapts the damping at each individual wheel to the current demand - always taking into account the preselected suspension level, the driving style and the condition of the road surface. In addition to an improvement in ride quality and comfort, this leads, above all, to an increase in driving safety. There is a choice of three different damping maps (\"Comfort\", \"Sport\" and \"Sport+\").",
            "Active roll stabilisation as standard on the GLC63 S E PERFORMANCE",
            "Another feature makes a decisive contribution to the AMG-specific set-up for high driving dynamics: AMG ACTIVE RIDE CONTROL active roll stabilisation as standard in the GLC63 S E PERFORMANCE. Instead of using conventional, rigid anti-roll bars, the system compensates body movements electromechanically. For this purpose, the anti-roll bars on the front and rear axles are divided into two parts. In the centre is an electromechanical actuator in which a three-stage planetary gear is integrated. When the road surface is uneven or the driving style is moderate, the actuator actively separates the stabiliser halves, which increases driving comfort. During dynamic use, for example on a winding road, the halves join together and are twisted against each other.",
            "Moreover, the system not only reduces rolling movements when cornering, but also allows more precise tuning of the steering and load cycle behaviour. In addition, it increases ride comfort when driving in a straight line because stimuli by one-sided road bumps are balanced out, for example. Movements in the body can be actively and optimally adjusted to the driving conditions. This allows the driver to experience the hallmark AMG driving characteristics in terms of dynamics, precision and feedback even more intensively.",
            "To meet the high power requirements, the system is based on an additional 48-volt on-board sub-network. Another benefit compared with the usual hydraulic-based systems is the significantly faster response. Added to this is the lower weight of the components compared to hydraulic solutions.",
            "Three-stage AMG speed-sensitive steering and standard rear-axle steering",
            "The steering layout of the Mercedes-AMG GLC models contributes equally to the increase in dynamics and comfort. The three-stage AMG speed-sensitive steering system, for example, features a variable steering geometry ratio that adapts to the selected drive program. At high speeds, the steering power assistance decreases; at low speeds it is steadily increased. As a result, comparatively little steering effort is required at low speeds, as well as when manoeuvring and parking, while the best possible control over the vehicle is maintained when driving faster. In the \"Sport\" and \"Sport+\" suspension settings, the driver also experiences significantly more feedback about the driving conditions via the steering wheel.",
            "Active rear-axle steering is also on board as standard. It operates with a maximum steering angle of 2.5°. Up to this point, the rear wheels turn in the opposite direction to the front wheels at speeds of up to 100 km/h (variable depending on the AMG DYNAMICS setting). This leads to a virtual shortening of the wheelbase, which in turn results in significantly more agile turn-in, less steering effort and improved manoeuvrability. For example, the turning circle is noticeably reduced when turning or parking. At speeds above 100 km/h (variable depending on the AMG DYNAMICS setting), on the other hand, the rear wheels turn in parallel to the front wheels - up to a maximum of 0.7°. This virtual extension of the wheelbase has a positive effect on driving stability, leads to a faster build-up of lateral force when changing direction and thus to a more direct reaction of the vehicle to steering commands. The response of the rear-axle steering depends on the selected AMG DYNAMIC SELECT driving mode.",
            "AMG sports braking system and AMG exhaust system with sporty engine sound",
            "The AMG sports brake system in the GLC43 guarantees outstanding deceleration values and optimum control. Internally ventilated and perforated brake discs measuring 370 x 36 millimetres with 4-piston fixed callipers are fitted to the front axle and 360 x 26 millimetres with 1-piston floating callipers to the rear.",
            "In keeping with the extreme power values and the associated performance, the AMG high-performance composite brake system with 6-piston fixed callipers at the front (internally ventilated and perforated brake discs 390 x 36 mm) and 1-piston floating callipers at the rear (internally ventilated and perforated brake discs 370 x 26 mm) comes as standard on the GLC63 S. The brake system impresses with very short braking distances as well as maximum stability and fade-resistance under heavy use. In addition, it scores with a long service life and a particularly fast response.",
            "Numerous equipment packages make the Mercedes-AMG GLC SUV models even more individual",
            "The AMG Exterior Night Package I includes the painted exterior mirror housings in high-gloss black, the inlays in the AMG side sill trims, the shoulderline trim strip, the window surrounds and the trim strip in the rear bumper. Added to this are heat-insulating dark-tinted glass from the B-pillar and the two black chrome-plated twin tailpipe trims of the AMG exhaust system.",

            "The AMG Aerodynamics Package enhances the dynamic visual impression. The aerodynamic elements include the larger front splitter in high-gloss black with flics on the sides, the AMG Performance air flow break-away edge in body colour and additional flics for the air outlets in the rear apron in high-gloss black. The AMG Exterior Night Package I and the AMG Exterior Night Package II are also on board. The AMG fuel filler cap in silver chrome with \"AMG\" lettering emphasises the special status of the edition.",

            "Bugatti is known across the world for visionary engineering and ingenious designs, and the brand celebrates the official centenary of the racing debut of one of its most innovative cars: the Type 32 'Tank'. This streamlined racing car was to lay the foundations for aerodynamic motorsport innovations, earning its nickname not only for its shape, but also for its visible rivets and bolts.",
            "The occasion was the French Grand Prix of 2 July 1923, the venue the city of Tours in the beautiful Loire Valley, where 300,000 spectators gathered to enjoy an event that promised plenty of high-octane excitement from an array of cutting-edge race cars. The car that attracted the most attention, however, was the bold machine that was testament to the genius of Ettore Bugatti, and his relentless quest for improvement by defying convention.",
            "What immediately caught the eye about the slipstreamed Type 32 was the airplane-inspired wing-shaped body, a result of Bugatti's conviction that advanced aerodynamics would have an increasingly important role to play in enhancing the performance of racing cars. Although under the skin it was based heavily on the Type 30 - with its 2.0-litre eight-cylinder engine developing in the region of 90 PS - the unusual fairing, relatively short wheelbase and narrow track meant it looked like little else on the grid and caused a stir among the watching fans.",
            "The car benefited from numerous innovative engineering solutions, techniques and designs. There was an underslung chassis and front hydraulic brakes, while a three-speed and reverse transaxle transmission added to the sense of adventure. Unsurprisingly, such an unorthodox car - with dramatic idiosyncratic looks - was very much the center of attention, standing out from a line-up of racers that adhered to widely used and instantly recognizable design norms that were typical at the time for a motorsport car.",
            "In total, five Type 32s were built - a prototype plus the four cars which took part in the Grand Prix, an affair that constituted a grueling 35 laps of the 22.83-kilometer circuit on public roads, for a total distance of just under 800 kilometers. Of these four cars, the most successful was piloted by French driver Ernest Friderich, who finished third, completing the race in seven hours and 22.4 seconds at an average speed of just over 112 km/h. It was a creditable finish for the Type 32, but Tours was to prove its only GP appearance, as Bugatti instead focused on developing the iconic Type 35. This legendary Bugatti featured a host of new ideas - including the introduction of alloy wheels - and enjoyed phenomenal success, winning the Grand Prix World Championship in 1926.",
            "Despite its short GP career, the Type 32 proved an invaluable exercise for Bugatti, and many of the lessons learned were ultimately to pay dividends. In particular, the belief that aerodynamic efficiency could play such a pivotal, decisive role was proven conclusively in another race car whose streamlined, enclosed body earned it the 'Tank' moniker, the 57G. It dominated endurance racing for a glorious period in the 1930s, securing victory in the 1936 French Grand Prix and even more notably at Le Mans in 1937, demonstrating that Ettore Bugatti's vision, first realized in the Type 32 'Tank' of 1923, had been proven correct.",
            "To this day the Type 32 is still instantly recognizable to many motorsport fans, an iconic and innovative Bugatti creation. This Bugatti masterpiece rests at Musée National de l'Automobile in Mulhouse, France, and can still be seen competing in action at certain historic races."

The integrated Torque Kick Drift function allows the driver to simulate the clutch kick action of rear-wheel-driven ICE vehicles for driving scenarios that require more immediate drift initiation. This is a result of sophisticated electronic control technology.",
            "N Torque Distribution provides fully variable front and rear torque distribution that can be adjusted to 11 levels. The e-LSD (electronic limited slip differential) at the rear axle optimizes cornering performance and control. Additional wheel sensors and broader damping capacity with increased damper size widens the performance range of the electronically controlled suspension.",
            "Improved PE system, enhanced battery cooling and N Brake Regen bolster Racetrack Capability",
            "This powerful EV benefits from several technical improvements. Its electric motors spin up to 21,000 RPM providing 478 kW / 650 PS with N Grin Boost engaged. This is a result of the two-stage inverter with increased energy efficiency for stronger power output from the new 84 kWh battery.",
            "Several exclusive features aid track performance. N Grin Boost maximizes acceleration by a power increment of 10 seconds and N Launch Control provides three different traction levels for the fastest possible start, allowing drivers to launch their vehicle like a professional race car. Track SOC (state-of-charge) automatically calculates battery consumption per lap.",
            "IONIQ 5 N sets a new benchmark for thermal management in severe racetrack conditions. Compared to its competitors, IONIQ 5 N boasts a higher resistance to heat induced power degradation - loss of maximum power due to overheating.",
            "The enhanced battery thermal management system, with increased cooling area, better motor oil cooler and battery chiller. The independent radiators for the battery and motor maximize IONIQ 5 N's resistance to performance degradation before and during intense track driving.",
            "Before driving, the driver can utilize N Battery Pre-conditioning to optimize the battery cells to the most power-efficient temperature by choosing between 'Drag' mode for a short burst of full power or 'Track' mode that optimizes the lowest possible battery temperature for more laps.",
            "N Race feature further optimizes the EV's endurance on the circuit, giving drivers more direct control over the car's energy usage. N Race applies a motorsport-derived approach to maximizing resources for the fastest possible times. While this type of setting change would normally require a team of mechanics and equipment, IONIQ 5 N offers it at the convenience of a few button presses.",
            "With N Race, drivers are given the strategic choice to prioritize 'Endurance' or 'Sprint.' 'Endurance' maximizes range on the racetrack. This is achieved by limiting the peak power, which results in a slower build-up of temperature. Comparatively, 'Sprint' prioritizes power and provides shorter bursts of full energy. This will help drivers accurately manage their energy strategy and create an ideal performance window to achieve their driving performance targets.",
            "IONIQ 5 N boasts N-tuned brakes, which represent Hyundai's most powerful braking system. It features 400-mm diameter front discs with four-piston monobloc calipers and 360-mm rear discs. These brakes are constructed with new lightweight materials and optimized airflow for improved cooling efficiency. In addition, the regenerative (regen) braking system typically used for enhanced efficiency has been reinterpreted in IONIQ 5 N to enhance braking performance. It serves as the primary source of brake force, while the mechanical brakes supplement additional braking force when required, ensuring enhanced endurance on the track.",
            "To address the harsh braking demands of the Nürburgring Nordschleife, Hyundai N engineers designed N Brake Regen, an N-specific region braking system developed specifically for IONIQ 5 N. It offers up to a maximum of 0.6 G decelerative force - an industry leading figure - through N Brake Regen alone and remains engaged under ABS activation with a maximum of 0.2 G. The risk of brake fade due to the EV's relative heaviness is minimized by maximizing regen braking power, which results in lower brake force applied to the mechanical brakes.",
            "The seamless blending between the N Brake Regen and hydraulic brakes creates a smooth transition that is imperceptible to the driver. Moreover, left foot braking allows the brake and accelerator pedal to work at the same time when driving on the track.",

So the electric motors and battery technology come from the Mission R and the chassis from the 718 GT4 Clubsport. Following its world premiere at the 2023 Goodwood Festival of Speed, the design study will be on display at the Rennsport Reunion in the USA at the end of September 2023.",
            "Exterior design: shortened front windscreen and one-sided tonneau cover",
            "The concept car has the squat, shortened windscreen that is typical of a speedster, lending even more emphasis to the car's monolithic body. Spanning the right side of the car is a tonneau cover of the type once common on open-top sports cars. The driver's headrest appears suspended in the air due to the technically designed carbon roll-over element behind it. Behind that is the charge port door and the anchor for the classic speedster top.",
            "The two-colour concept with the two grey tones Marble Grey and Grivelo Grey Metallic is inspired by historic motorsport forerunners, such as the front fenders used to protect against flying rocks in race scenarios and the front wings, which feature the darker Metallic colour. The front wheels are also painted in Grivelo Grey Metallic. This is complemented by contrasts in Miami Blue, for example on the quick-release mechanisms on the wrap-around front bonnet.",
            "The anniversary logo with the large \"75\" and the two years \"1948\" and \"2023\" feature Grivelo Grey Metallic and Miami Blue - a fresh alternative to the decorative elements of the coupé Vision 357, where red was used as an additional colour. Above this are comic-style unicorns in front of the rear wheels. The mythical creature was drawn specifically for the concept car by Porsche designers, who also put their hand to the punchy \"Speedster\" logo. Cameras replace the exterior mirrors. As in the classic forebears, they are not positioned on the doors, but further forward on the fenders. In the open-top 357, they feature a new, aerodynamically optimised shape reminiscent of wings.",
            "Other details of the exterior design are familiar from its sister concept car: the four-point light signet on the front features a round design evocative of the Porsche 356. The rear lights sit behind a patterned array of points milled in the body itself. Another nod to the first Porsche model line is the vertical grille pattern in the rear. The third brake light is integrated in the grille design.",
            "The wide track makes a bullish impression and enhances driving stability. The 20-inch wheels are made of magnesium and are equipped with carbon fibre hubcaps and central locks. Visually, they also recall a legendary Porsche wheel: the 356 A and 356 B with drum brakes had rims with the notably large bolt circle of 205 millimetres.",
            "Interior design: purist, reduced cockpit",
            "The interior is reduced to the essential and fully tailored to the driver. The low-slung seat position is quintessentially sporty. The CFRP seat shell is integrated in the monocoque. The driver sits on Racetex-covered pads and held firmly in place by six-point seat belt with a Miami Blue belt strap. The instrument cluster sits atop the steering column as a transparent surface. The racing steering wheel exemplifies lightness, while the impact absorber appears as if suspended. The individual controls, meanwhile, revisit the accent colour Miami Blue from the exterior.",

The SC63, which will begin testing within weeks, is set to compete in the Hypercar class of the 2024 FIA World Endurance Championship, including the 24 Hours of Le Mans, and in the GTP class of the IMSA WeatherTech Sports Car Championship Endurance Cup, comprising classic races such as the 24 Hours of Daytona and 12 Hours of Sebring. Lamborghini has partnered with Italian team Iron Lynx to run the car in international competition and has signed world-class drivers from the world of Formula 1 and endurance racing.",
            "The LMDh project represents a new concept of racing and fits the Direzione Cor Tauri strategy presented in 2021: a roadmap for electrification leading the company to hybridize the entire model range by the end of 2024 enhancing driving emotions and performances at the same time. Thanks to the SC63 this approach has been applied also to the motorsport programme representing a new pillar of the Lamborghini Manifesto: Driving Humans Beyond.",
            "\"The SC63 is the most advanced racing car ever produced by Lamborghini and it follows our roadmap 'Direzione Cor Tauri' laid out by the brand for the electrification of our product range,\" says Stephan Winkelmann, Lamborghini Chairman and CEO. \"The opportunity to compete in some of the biggest endurance races in the world with a hybrid prototype fits with our vision for the future of high-performance mobility, as demonstrated for road legal cars with the launch of the Revuelto. The SC63 LMDh is the step into the highest echelons and into the future of motorsports for our Squadra Corse.\"",
            "The Lamborghini SC63 features an all-new 3.8-liter twin turbo V8 engine that has been developed by Lamborghini engineers specifically for the racing program. The engine is a 'cold V' configuration, meaning that the turbos are mounted outside the vee angle of the engine which makes them easier to cool and to service. Furthermore, the 'cold V' solution lowers the mass and optimizes the car's centre of gravity. This solution, combined with a specifically developed aero balance and attitude, has been identified as the most effective to achieve the best tyre grip, and perfect balance, drivability and consistent speed both over a single lap but also across long distance races.",
            "Power from the engine and the hybrid system, which is standard across the LMDh-category cars, is limited by regulation to 500kW (680 CV). The Power Unit is managed by a Bosch electronic control unit. The LMDh rule set specifies a standard gearbox, battery and motor generator unit (MGU), which helps to contain the development costs for the prototype.",
            "Under the skin, Lamborghini engineers have been able to exert their influence over all aspects of the car. Although the gearbox is standard across all LMDh cars, there is still freedom to customise it to a brand's requirements including the selection of the gear ratios and the slip of the mechanical differential.",
            "\"Motorsport is, to us, also a valuable and demanding proving ground for our technology,\" states Rouven Mohr, Lamborghini Chief Technical Officer \"Our LMDh car, the Lamborghini SC63, is an exciting challenge from both a technical and a human standpoint. The development of our internal combustion engine, aerodynamically efficient bodywork and the overall technical package is a process that has pushed us to constantly raise our own standards. Now, it is time to put the wheels in motion, literally, on track in order to be ready and competitive for the 2024 season. As we develop our LMDh car, we are also mindful of the technology transfer opportunities. We will take our learning experiences from motorsport and apply them where possible to our future production cars.\"",
            "Lamborghini has selected renowned experts Ligier as its partner to develop and build the monocoque. As the first manufacturer to select Ligier on an LMDh project, there was freedom for Lamborghini to specify its requirements, including the development of the push rod front suspension design, overall weight distribution and ease of service for critical parts of the car. The bellhousing, which fills the gap between the rear of the engine and the front of the gearbox, positively affects torsional stiffness, and has been designed to house the electric engine.",
            "Another key aspect of development is the braking system, which must deliver the highest level of performance and reliability in all conditions. Endurance racing places a lot of stress on the brakes and the first target has been to find a compromise between weight and durability, effective cooling, and also a system that is able to accommodate different styles of driving.",
            "The bodywork has been designed by Lamborghini's Centro Stile design department, in conjunction with the race design team. It features very clear brand styling cues throughout the car, including the iconic y-shaped lights at the front and rear.",
            "\"From the beginning, my personal briefing to the design-team was that the car needs to be highly functional, but we wanted to create a car that is immediately recognizable as Lamborghini,\" says Mitja Borkert, Lamborghini's Head of Design at Centro Stile. \"The main recognition of the front and rear of the SC63 is driven by the y-shaped signature light. The size of the cabin and the main character of the car is driven by the sporting rules, but we have also implemented our own brand styling cues throughout the car. Integrated into the side panel of the body you can see a NACA duct that was inspired by the air intake of the Countach. When you look at the rear wheel arch, we gave the impression of acceleration towards the front, and this relates to the wheel arch design language of Lamborghini that can also been seen on the Revuelto.\"",
            "The cars will be dressed in a familiar livery, in keeping with the branding seen on the Huracán GT3 challenger. The SC63s will run in Verde Mantis green, with a black Nero Noctis strip over the cabin, front hood, carbon diffuser, rear fin and wing. The cars will also feature green, white and red Italian Tricolore colours, and will carry the branding of long-time partner of Lamborghini, Swiss watch manufacturer Roger Dubuis.",
            "The cooling layout for the car has decided much of the engineering and design. For example, air intakes into the sidepods behind the cockpit underwent several iterations before a final design was settled upon. The team has incorporated eight different radiators including two intercoolers, one gearbox radiator, one condenser for the air conditioning, one radiator for the Energy Recovery System (ERS), one for the Energy Storage System (ESS) and two water radiators.",
            "One of the limitations of the regulation is that there is only one body kit configuration allowed, and changes that teams are allowed to make to that kit race-to-race are limited. The design team therefore has to take into account the worst-case scenario, such as high ambient temperatures, and manage the thermal efficiency of the car at both IMSA and WEC circuits.",
            "The Lamborghini SC63 has been designed and developed to offer the widest 'operating window' possible, to optimize performance while also being able to look after its tires even on the most aggressive track surfaces. Ahead track testing, intense development work has been carried out in the virtual world using a Driver in the Loop (DiL) simulator.",
            "Further help has come from the Lamborghini factory drivers Mirko Bortolotti and Andrea Caldarelli, together with new drivers Daniil Kvyat and Romain Grosjean. The latter two have recent race experience of hybrids in Formula 1 and have been able to help the engineers to tune the LMDh system, in particular design the steering wheel controls to allow the driver to control the necessary functions of the hybrid system.",
            "\"This year marks not only the 60th anniversary of our brand, but also the tenth anniversary of Squadra Corse, Lamborghini's motorsport division,\" says Giorgio Sanna, Lamborghini's Head of Motorsport. \"Over the last decade we have achieved great results. Starting from scratch we have won some of the most prestigious endurance races in the GT category for our production-based racing cars. These include three class wins at the 24 hours of Daytona, and two wins in a row at the Sebring 12 hours. Now we are ready for what is our biggest step into the future of motorsport, measuring ourselves against the best manufacturers in the world.\"",
            "Starting in 2024, one car will compete in the full FIA World Endurance Championship. The second car will race in the North American Endurance Championship races of the IMSA series. The Iron Lynx team, presented as a partner at the 2022 Lamborghini Grand Finals, will run the cars in both series, and the driving line up will include Bortolotti, Caldarelli, Grosjean and Kvyat.",
            "Iron Lynx Team Principal and CEO, Andrea Piccini, said: \"Being involved in such an ambitious project is a once in a lifetime experience. We are honoured and extremely excited to be part of it and to start a new chapter for Iron Lynx with Lamborghini. It's been amazing to see everything finally come together for the reveal of the SC63. Everyone at Iron Lynx is eager for testing to get underway. This is undoubtedly one of the biggest challenges we've ever faced as a team, and we are now looking forward to seeing the SC63 on track.\""

Supplied by technical partner Mercedes-AMG, the all-aluminium, turbocharged 2.0-litre unit is based on the world's most powerful four-cylinder in series production.",
            "Badged for launch as the Emira First Edition, it has been further developed by Lotus with new intake and exhaust systems, plus a bespoke calibration matched to new transmission shift-mapping. Developing 360bhp and 430Nm, this makes it a perfect match to the Emira's lightweight, strong, stiff, bonded and extruded aluminium chassis structure and aligns to the Lotus ethos of delivering higher performance by reducing mass.",
            "It's also fitting that, as the final mainstream combustion engine Lotus two-seater, the Emira is the most powerful four-cylinder from Lotus in a rich bloodline of iconic models including the Elise, Esprit, Europa, Elan and Elite. And, at 180bhp/litre, it also has the highest specific power output in the Emira range.",
            "Like the renowned 400bhp supercharged V6, the four-cylinder car delivers all the performance and responsiveness that drivers expect - 0-62mph (0-100km/h) in just 4.4 seconds and a 180mph (290km/h) maximum speed - while bringing its own unique character to the Emira range. That character is enhanced by the inherent day-to-day usability and comfort of the smooth and rapid shifting dual-clutch transmission. It also offers the added advantages of lower fuel consumption and a target CO2 emissions figure of 208g/km (WLTP combined).",
            "Mike Johnstone, Group Vice-President and Chief Commercial Officer, Lotus, said: \"The Emira V6 has already proved incredibly successful, with many thousands of orders received from around the world.

We've calibrated engine and transmission mapping, in tandem with the Drive Modes, to create a refined and relaxed character in Tour, and with incredible launch performance, superb driveability, even quicker throttle response and kickdown in Sport and Track. We've also taken the opportunity to refine how the powertrain is linked to the traction and stability control systems to deliver the high-performance feel and connection that Lotus drivers expect.\"",
            "Like the Emira V6, the new 2.0-litre car is built in the Chapman Production Centre (CPC) at Hethel, named in honour of the company's legendary founder and inspiration. However, it starts life at Lotus Advanced Structures in nearby Norwich, where sub-assembly of the lightweight aluminium chassis structure takes place. Combined, these world-class centres of excellence for sports car manufacturing are part of a £100 million investment by Lotus in its UK facilities. Customers in the UK have the option of collecting their Emira from Hethel and, as part of the experience, tour the CPC assembly halls where their car was made.",
            "Powertrain: powerful, responsive, efficient",
            "Designed solely for high-performance applications, the 1,991cc engine features a cylinder block produced using the advanced chill-casting process: compared to conventional sand-casting methods used in high volume applications, this results in a uniform, fine-grained structure which delivers the high strength and durability needed to withstand the high loads generated. Following motorsport practise, the block is also of closed-deck design for maximum stiffness, and instead of conventional cast iron liners, the cylinder bores use a patented low-friction coating to save weight. For the optimal balance of high strength and low weight, both the steel crankshaft and aluminium pistons are forged.",
            "The cylinder head features four valves per cylinder and a 200bar direct injection system. Intake and exhaust cams feature variable valve timing, while on the exhaust side, the valves can be varied between high and low duration. The piezo injectors deliver fuel into the combustion chamber with very high precision, both in terms of the amount of fuel and the spray pattern, resulting in enhanced combustion with reduced emissions. For maximum power, the piezo injectors are joined by the port fuel injectors, mounted directly on the intake side of the cylinder head to deliver the correct amount of petrol needed at full load.",
            "The turbocharger is a 'twin-scroll' design, meaning the turbine housing is split into two separate ducts, matched to corresponding ducts in the exhaust manifold. This minimises exhaust gas pulsation interference, helping to improve the efficient exchange of gases in the cylinders. It also ensures that boost pressure builds up more rapidly, and to further enhance responsiveness, the shaft joining the compressor and turbine wheel runs in ultra-low-friction roller bearings. To manage boost pressure most effectively, the wastegate is electronically controlled.",
            "This combination of advanced technologies, together with intake and exhaust systems developed by Lotus and optimised with a unique in-house calibration, ensure this remarkable engine can deliver an astonishing balance of power, torque and efficiency throughout its full operating range. Generating 430Nm from 3,000-5,500rpm and 360bhp at 6,600rpm before reaching a maximum speed of 7,200rpm, it ensures an authentic Lotus sports car driving experience while also being refined in day-to-day use.",
            "Sending drive to the rear wheels is Mercedes-AMG's acclaimed eight-speed dual-clutch transmission (DCT) - a first use of the technology by Lotus and fitted exclusively to the Emira. Compared to the six-speed manual and automatic transmissions offered on the Emira V6, the DCT offers even quicker gearchanges with no torque interruption during shifting, enhancing efficiency and shift comfort. Drivers also have the choice of smooth, effortless changes if they leave the car in Drive, or ultra-fast dynamic changes if they control the transmission themselves using the shift lever in the centre console or steering wheel paddles.",
            "Launch control enables the driver to set the car up for optimum acceleration from a standing start by maximising the available traction from the rear wheels and torque from the powertrain. This feature enables consistent, optimal get-aways - time and time again - allowing the driver to fully exploit the Emira's exhilarating performance.",
            "Vehicle dynamics: agile, intuitive, rewarding",
            "The Emira's light, stiff, bonded aluminium Lotus Sports Car Architecture gave the vehicle dynamics engineers the perfect platform from which to develop the car's ride, handling and steering characteristics, all of which set the class benchmark, as every Lotus sports car should. With a torsional stiffness of 26,300Nm/ degree, the chassis contributes to the immediate, precise responses of every system. The Emira features race-derived, lightweight, forged aluminium double-wishbone suspension all round, which delivers the greatest control of the tyre contact patch throughout the suspension's full range of travel, contributing to the Emira's exceptional agility and responsiveness.",
            "The introduction of the four-cylinder engine to the Emira range created the opportunity for Lotus to introduce a new, lightweight cast aluminium rear subframe to optimise the packaging of the powerplant within the chassis structure. It's in place of the steel assembly used on the Emira V6 and contributes to a total weight saving of 12kg. The subframe also houses the new rear suspension.",
            "The electro-hydraulic steering system delivers the pure, truly connected feel fundamental to Lotus sports car DNA, together with speed-dependent efforts, but without the losses created by an engine-driven pump. The immediacy of response to every input the driver makes is amplified by the seating position being almost in the centre of the 2,575mm wheelbase, thanks to the Emira's mid-engine configuration.",
            "The Eibach springs and Bilstein high-pressure monotube dampers are meticulously tuned to suit the Emira, and offered with different settings depending on whether the customer chooses the Tour or Sport chassis settings. Tour is optimised for road use, offering softer springs and dampers, while Sport is track-focused with stiffer springs and dampers, together with increased camber and toe angles to maximise grip. The anti-roll bar stiffnesses are also bespoke to Emira, and the component on the front axle is now lighter too.",
            "A choice of specially-developed tyres is available on the four-cylinder Emira, which are asymmetrically sized to suit the exacting requirements of steering and traction - 245/35/R20 on the front axle and 295/30/R20 at the rear. Fitted as standard as part of the Tour chassis (and also available as an option with the Sports chassis), the Goodyear Eagle F1 Supersport tyres deliver high performance with enhanced all-weather capability without any compromise to feedback. Offered exclusively as part of the Sports chassis, the Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tyres are designed for extreme track use without compromising ride comfort. Both tyres have 'LTS' markings on the side wall to denote the Lotus-approved specification",
            "The braking system provides stopping power commensurate with the new engine's output, and features lightweight, two-piece, cross-drilled and slotted discs together with four-piston calipers on the front axle. The calipers can be finished in a choice of four colours at no extra cost.",
            "Complementing the changes to the chassis hardware is a completely new calibration for the Electronic Stability Control system. There's also an e-Diff function which can apply carefully modulated brake pressure to the rear wheels in order to maximise traction by the transfer of torque to the one with the most grip, which is particularly beneficial when accelerating out of slow corners. It also enhances dynamic performance and control in challenging conditions, such as roads covered in snow, rain or mud.",
            "Exterior design: aerodynamically beautiful",
            "The Lotus Emira's design language is a development of the sculpted surfaces and technical detailing which debuted on the all-electric Evija hypercar, and brings unrivalled supercar desirability to the sports car segment. Strikingly beautiful, timeless and unmistakably Lotus, its perfect proportions and athletic, taught, shrink-wrapped form are the very embodiment of Lotus sports car DNA.",
            "The front is dominated by the full-LED headlights - each with a double 'blade' daytime running light signature - and purposeful, angular bonnet ducts. The latter guide airflow over the car, reducing drag, and reinforce the Emira's performance potential while making a direct visual link to the Evija.",
            "Sculpted doors feature deployable handles, also cutting drag, while the dramatic form pressed into the outer skin blends seamlessly into the intake ducts integrated into the muscular rear haunches. These feed air, via the water-cooled charge cooler, to the engine's intake system, and also help to cool the engine itself.",
            "The rear of the car features two distinctive gloss black vents, allowing air to flow out from the wheel arches. Beneath, also finished in gloss black, is the rear diffuser, into which the two exhaust pipes and rear number plate are neatly integrated.",
            "As a result of meticulous development using cutting-edge computational fluid dynamics simulations, and further refinement in the wind tunnel, the Emira doesn't need any active aerodynamic features, and creates passive downforce that's perfectly balanced between the front and rear axles at all speeds. The result is enhanced grip and handling characteristics which remain constant, precise and predictable.",
            "The Emira can be specified in a range of 13 colours, each one created to heighten the visual impact of the Emira's dramatic, purposeful form: Hethel Yellow, Magma Red, Vivid Red, Dark Verdant, Seneca Blue, Atlantis Blue, Meridian Blue, Osmium Silver, Nimbus Grey, Shadow Grey, Zinc Grey, Mist White and Cosmos Black.",
            "The optional Black Pack sees a contemporary gloss black finish applied to the roof, cantrails, mirror pods and the Lotus wordmark on the rear clamshell. The exhaust finishers are satin black. The 20-inch, ultra-lightweight forged wheels feature a diamond-cut finish as standard, with silver or gloss black available as options, completing the distinctive look.",
            "Emira inside: driver-focused and pure",
            "Luxurious, spacious and unmistakably driver-focused, the Lotus Emira's interior is beautifully crafted and effortlessly combines rich materials and the latest technologies to deliver levels of comfort, usability and practicality which set new standards for Lotus sports cars.",
            "Ahead of the flat-bottomed steering wheel is a 12.3-inch TFT instrument cluster, while in the centre of the cockpit is a 10.25-inch touchscreen for the infotainment system, which features integrated navigation All of the content was designed in-house, making it simple and intuitive to use, while enhancing the driving experience. Android Auto and Apple CarPlay connectivity is standard.",
            "The 10-channel, 560W premium audio system was developed for the Emira in partnership with KEF and features the renowned British brand's signature Uni-QTM technology, which combines tweeter and mid-range into a single, acoustically-optimised unit. Beautifully finished with a distinctive bespoke speaker fret design, Uni-Q covers the entire mid and high-frequency sound spectrum from a single point in space, delivering a more coherent, hyper-realistic sound experience.",
            "The 12-way power-adjust heated seats offer both incredible support for spirited driving as well as superb comfort on long drives, and are offered in Nappa leather in either black, red, ice grey or tan, or in black Alcantara with a choice of contrast stitching in either yellow, red or ice grey. These same materials are also offered on the steering wheel, as an option, with the top dead centre band and stitching available in yellow, red or ice grey. Black Alcantara is also used for the headliner, further enriching the cabin. Behind the two seats is 208-litres of storage, with the rear luggage compartment offering a further 151 litres."

Renault has sold 163,000 of this distinguished-looking Coupe SUV so far (240,000 in all, including Renault Korea Motors' XM3) and it is playing a pivotal role in the brand's plan to reconquer the C-segment, alongside Megane E-Tech electric and Austral.",
            "Arkana has rewritten the rules with its Coupe SUV style combining zip and roominess, and is now selling in markets on several continents - ranging from Australia, New Zealand and Japan to Israel and on to Chile. Its upmarket versions - R.S. Line then E-Tech Engineered - offer extra character and vigour, and have contributed a lot to its success (they account for 53% of the mix in Europe in 2023). The best-selling powertrain is the E-tech full hybrid 145 hp (63% of sales in Europe in the first six months of 2023).",

            "The New Renault Arkana combines an original fluid feel, imposing demeanour and heavy-duty build with Renault's new identity, to ride even higher on the \"Nouvelle Vague\". The Nouvel'R logo is built into the grille, at the centre of the Deep Glossy Black band linking the headlights. This surface is entirely flush and smooth, making it even more elegant.",
            "The Nouvel'R logo's design provides the basis for the new pattern on the grille - a deliberately unstructured assortment of diamonds reverberating around the one in the middle. A 3D effect on the diamonds' edges seems to carve them out and add depth. Depending on the trim (Evolution, Techno or Esprit Alpine), these features will be Black, Satin Chrome or Dark Chrome, to underline the shift upmarket. The vertical pattern on the upper grille makes the overall look more consistent with that on the grille at the base of the bumper.",
            "The aerodynamic blade that became an R.S. Line and E-Tech Engineered version hallmark is now on the bumper of the line-up's Techno and Esprit Alpine trims. It is the same colour as the body in the Techno version and Satin Grey in the Esprit Alpine version.",
            "The logo at the centre of the tailgate is Dark Chrome, matching the one at the front as well as the lettering and tailpipes. The lights have ever-so-slightly smoked crystal-like covers to add a modern touch.",
            "The chrome on the decorative features (grille, window rims, etc.) has been replaced by Black, Satin Black or Deep Glossy Black depending on the version.",
            "NEW ESPRIT ALPINE TRIM",
            "Like the other most recent models in Renault's line-up, the New Arkana now includes a sporty-chic Esprit Alpine trim at the top of the range - which beautifully befits the vehicle's personality.",
            "One of the exterior features is the Satin Gry blade on the front bumper. Another is the Shale Grey badge nestled in Deep Glossy Black on the wing trim. It also comes with new 19-inch openwork wheels that add to its stateliness as much as is sportiness. A new aileron cut to match the roof enhances the tailgate's aerodynamics.",
            "Inside, the seats are a mixture of Eco Tep (10% bio-sourced materials) and imitation suede (more than in the former R.S. Line and E-Tech Engineered high-end models). The seats now come with blue horizontal overstitching and the Alpine logo on the back, and the safety belts with two blue stripes.",
            "The inside of the doors and the steering wheel have red, white and blue stitching and the cladding on the dashboard area facing the front passenger seat is slate-like for an elegant, low-key effect.",
            "Whatever powertrain you choose, the cockpit in the New Arkana Esprit Alpine includes the e-shifter gear stick with no mechanical cabling.",

            "In addition to the aerodynamic blade matching the body, Techno has kept the same wheels as the R.S. Line and E-Tech Engineered versions. The logo and lettering at the rear are Satin Chrome.",
            "This line-up is introducing a new body colour, Midnight Blue, and comes with the same choice of powertrains: E-Tech full hybrid 145 hp and petrol mild hybrid 140 hp and 160 hp.",
            "THE E-TECH FULL HYBRID 145 HP POWERTRAIN WITH E-SAVE MODE",
            "The driving pleasure from the E-Tech full hybrid 145 hp powertrain is like nothing else: it is as smooth in electric mode as it is vigorous and efficient. It interlinks two electric motors (a 36 kW main motor and an 18 kW High-Voltage Starter Generator) with a 4-cylinder 1.6 litre 69 kW (94 hp) petrol engine, a smart multi-mode clutch-less dog box and a 1.2 kWh battery.",
            "The gearbox manages 4 ratios on the petrol engine and 2 ratios on the main electric motor. With the E-Tech full hybrid powertrain, in other words, you have up to 14 possible combinations between the engine and motor to optimise energy efficiency.",
            "The car invariably starts in electric mode and can run on the electric motor alone for up to 80% of the time in cities, which cuts consumption by up to 40% compared to a standard petrol engine. This high-efficiency powertrain's CO2 emissions can be as low as 105 g/km, which is outstanding in the category. Besides enjoying the silence in electric mode, you can enjoy the convenience of driving without stopping to charge the battery.",
            "The New Renault Arkana's E-Tech full hybrid 145 hp powertrain includes e-save feature. You can select it on the vehicle's centre screen in the vehicle' settings, or via the driving mode in versions that come with MULTI-SENSE settings, and it keeps the battery's charge at 40% at least, so you have that extra backup to keep on driving in electric mode if you need to, or to assist the engine on steep uphill slopes.",

            "The first new Speed Six in 93 years makes its global debut at the 2023 Goodwood Festival of Speed. The most successful Bentley racing car ever, the Speed Six is regarded as one of the most important Bentleys in history. The newest Speed Six - Car Zero - will be used in a development programme consisting of real-world durability and track based testing, before being retained by Bentley ahead of the build of 12 customer cars - all of which are already sold.",
            "So much more than a replica, a continuation car is built to the same designs, using the same processes, as the original car that inspires the series. The Speed Six is the second pre-war Continuation Series by Mulliner, Bentley's bespoke and coachbuilding division, following the Blower Continuation Series which itself was the first pre-war continuation ever created.",
            "Extensive research has been undertaken to ensure the content of the Speed Six is correct and authentic, with particular focus on the specification and setup of the original cars for the 1930 24 Hours of Le Mans. As many original drawings have been used as possible; with 80% of the originals found via the WO Bentley Memorial Foundation. The drawings have been supplemented by original mechanic's notes that detailed the changes between the 1929 and 1930 races, alongside data taken from the 1930 Speed Six in the Bentley Heritage Collection and an original 1930 Le Mans racer, known as Old Number 3.",
            "In excess of 600 individual new parts have been required for the creation of the new 6½-litre six-cylinder race spec engine. Initial dyno testing has shown the first engines to develop 205 bhp at their peak, within 5 bhp of that documented for the original race-tuned engines in 1930.",
            "Many of the authentic materials used on the Blower Continuation Series have also been utilised for the Speed Six, particularly on a number of the trimmed elements. Mulliner team members revisited the archives at the National Motor Museum in Beaulieu, Hampshire in order to offer five authentic period Parsons exterior paints. Speed Six Car Zero is finished in Parsons Napier Green, with an interior in Tan leather.",
            "Speed Six Car Zero has been built over the last ten months by an exceptionally skilled team of Mulliner artisans and specialists. As with the Blower Continuation Series, a major driver of the Speed Six programme is the development and retention of modern and traditional coachbuilding skills, and the build has seen craftspeople with decades of experience working alongside the younger generation so that skills are passed on. The finished car is a work of art, having been built and trimmed entirely in the Mulliner workshop at Bentley's Dream Factory in Crewe.",
            "Over the next six months customers will have chance to discuss their specifications in further detail in personal commissioning sessions. Customers will be offered a personal fitting service in the second development car, known as Speed Six Factory Works, to ensure each car is built to each individual customer's comfort needs.",
            "The validation programme for Speed Six Car Zero is comparable to that for Blower Car Zero, and will include real world mileage accumulation and two race simulations.",
            "The History Of The Speed Six",
            "The Speed Six became the most successful racing Bentley in history, as a high-performance version of the 6½ Litre, and won Le Mans in 1929 and 1930 at the hands of Woolf Barnato, Sir Henry 'Tim' Birkin and Glen Kidston.",
            "W.O. Bentley believed that the best way to increase power was to increase capacity, as opposed to Tim Birkin's faith in supercharging. He therefore developed a new, larger engine to succeed the 4½-litre. With a bore of 100 mm and a stroke of 140 mm, his new straight six had a capacity of almost 6.6 litres. In base form, with a single Smiths five-jet carburettor, twin magnetos and a compression ratio of 4.4:1, the 6½ Litre delivered 147 bhp at 3500 rpm. 362 examples were built at Bentley's factory in Cricklewood, North London, on a variety of chassis of different lengths depending on the body style requirements of individual customers.",
            "The Speed Six chassis was introduced in 1928 as a more sporting version of the 6½ Litre. The engine was modified to liberate more power, with twin SU carburettors, a higher compression ratio and a high-performance camshaft, responsible for an increase to 180 bhp. The Speed Six chassis was available to customers with wheelbases of 138 inches (3,505 mm), 140.5 inches (3,569 mm), and 152.5 inches (3,874 mm), with the short chassis being the most popular. 182 Speed Six models were built between 1928 and 1930, and the factory race cars were built on a 134 inch (11'2\") chassis frame.",
            "The racing version of the Speed Six had a further-developed engine running a compression ratio of 6.1:1 and producing 200 bhp. Two wins at Le Mans in 1929 and 1930 cemented the Speed Six's place in Bentley history, with the 1929 victory setting a new benchmark for dominance at the race. Driven by Woolf Barnato and Sir Henry 'Tim' Birkin, a Speed Six led from the first lap until the chequered flag, followed by a procession of three other Bentleys. A new lap record of 7:21 had been set by Birkin, taking 46 seconds off the previous best and requiring an average speed of 83 mph, and in covering a 2,844 km distance, a further record was also attained. Such a dominant performance by one manufacturer was not seen again at Le Mans for nearly 30 years.",
            "Real Life Endurance",
            "Speed Six Car Zero, displayed at 2023 Goodwood Festival of Speed, will show further instrumentation that will not be fitted to customer cars. This has been added to the car to support the validation process and record many different aspects of data during the next six months.",
            "With the build of Car Zero now complete, a programme of real-world durability testing will begin. The test programme is designed to achieve the equivalent of 35,000 kilometres of real-world driving across 8,000 kilometres of track driving. Intervals of gradually increasing duration and speed will check functionality and durability under the most challenging conditions; giving confidence in future customer cars.",
            "The first customer car will start build in October 2023, and the series of 12 customer cars is due to be completed by the end of 2025, with each car taking 10 months to complete."

            "Project V uses a battery electric powertrain, powered by a 200kW (272PS) single motor mounted in the rear axle. This is paired with a 55kWh USOC lithium-ion battery pack with advanced thermal management, and the ability to recharge from 20-80% in as little as 15 minutes using a 150kW DC rapid charger.",
            "With acceleration of 0-62mph (100kph) in less than 4.5 seconds, Project V will reach an estimated top speed of 143mph (230kph) and deliver a target WLTP range of 249 miles (400km).",
            "The minimalist design philosophy means Project V, just like the Seven, is lightweight and simple. Caterham has targeted a kerb weight of 1,190kg (2+1 configuration) which will be achieved by using an innovative carbon fibre and aluminium composite chassis.",
            "Bob Laishley, CEO of Caterham Cars Ltd and COO of the newly established Caterham EVo, said: \"Project V is not just a concept or design study, we've conducted engineering and production feasibility throughout the development process. An electric Caterham of any shape and size has to stay true to what sets us apart from everyone else: being lightweight, simple and offering an unparalleled driving experience; that's our DNA.\" He added: \"Project V fulfils our ambition to sustainably grow the company and explore electrification simultaneously. Subject to the next phases of development and technical capability, Project V could be brought to market towards the end of 2025 or early 2026 with a target price starting from less than £80,000.\"",
            "Anthony Jannarelly, Chief Designer for Project V, added: \"A Caterham Seven's design is simple and minimalist, it's designed for its intended function, to be lightweight and fun to drive. With Project V, we're applying this philosophy to the sports coupé architecture to create a seducing and timeless silhouette. Every single feature has to justify itself from a weight perspective to maintain lightness and optimise driver engagement.\"",
            "The Project V show car uses a 2+1 seating layout - 2+2 as optional - which optimises ingress and egress, provides more comfort for the rear seat passenger and offers greater flexibility in how a prospective owner may use the car. At the centre of the interior is a simple, driver-focussed infotainment system featuring smartphone mirroring, and a digital instrument cluster is used to display key information. Drivers can choose between Normal, Sport and Sprint driving modes that intelligently adjust the acceleration and steering for different environments.",
            "The concept features double wishbone front and rear suspension with fully adjustable geometry, electrically assisted power steering, Michelin Pilot Sport 4S tyres (19\" front and 20\" rear), and brake discs all-round with high-performance calipers.",
            "Andrea Porta, Business Development Manager at Italdesign, said: \"We're delighted to have partnered with Caterham and Anthony Jannarelly to bring Project V to life. At every step, we have applied our experience in producing commercially viable concept and prototype vehicles, to ensure that any future production version can be brought to market at pace.\"",
            "Laishley continued: \"Project V isn't instead of Seven, it's complimentary to it, and we believe that by retaining the core Caterham values, it will appeal to both our existing customer base and attract new fans to the brand. By using a more practical coupé body style and by exploiting the packaging benefits of an EV, this is a car that works as well for trips to the shops, or the school run, as it does for Sunday morning sprints.\"",
            "Kazuho Takahashi, President and CEO of VT Holdings, said: \"We are honoured to be able to unveil two new vehicles from Caterham at Goodwood Festival of Speed. The new models are a result of an uncompromising fusion of two seemingly contradictory requirements: retaining the Caterham values that must never change, while evolving to meet the changing demands of customers, such as the shift towards electric. We express our deepest gratitude to all those involved in this project and to everyone who has supported Caterham over the past 50 years.\"",

            "Ferrari unveiled the latest addition to its One-Off series, the Ferrari KC23. The latest in the marque's Special Projects programme, it was commissioned by one of the Prancing Horse's leading collectors. The KC23 one-off is a bold and extreme vision of what the closed wheel racing of the future may look like. A superlative new take on the most successful track car in Maranello's 76-year history, the 488 GT3 in its 'Evo 2020' version, it pulls off the incredible feat of exuding elegance when at a standstill and thrilling the viewer once on the move, thanks to ground-breaking aerodynamic solutions, such as motorised air intake vents and an imposing rear wing.",
            "Designed by the Ferrari Styling Centre led by Flavio Manzoni, the KC23 is based on the 488 GT3 Evo 2020 platform from which it inherits its layout, chassis and engine. The base for the project was very special indeed: the 488 GT3 has been racing since 2016 and to date, it has triumphed in the world's most prestigious endurance races, racking up over 530 victories and winning more than 119 championships, making it the most successful racing Ferrari in history.",
            "Given the extreme nature of its engine, chassis and suspension set-up, the Ferrari KC23 was designed exclusively for non-competitive track use. Its most unusual feature is its dual configuration. At a standstill, the car's layout showcases its clean, sleek, sinuous forms, but once it hits the track its visual stance is dominated by its impressive air intakes, which open automatically, and its imposing rear wing.",
            "From the very earliest days of the project and in agreement with the client, the Ferrari Styling Centre focused on creating a radical one-off car completely free of homologation constraints and clothed in the kind of timeless lines that would make an instant classic whilst also providing a tantalising glimpse of the future of supercars. That challenging goal demanded that every single one of the 488 GT3 Evo 2020's lines being redesigned, glass surfaces and light clusters included.",
            "The result is that the car has a monolithic beauty, as if it were sculpted from a single block of metal. The design also hides several of the car's technical functions, particularly the side air intakes, which open automatically when the mid-rear V8 twin turbo is turned on. This gives the KC23 an almost lifelike look, as its shape changes depending on what it is being used for. The rear wing is also removable to underline its clean, formal lines when not on the track.",
            "The surface treatment is smooth and seamless, with sharp angles reduced to an absolute minimum to underscore the Ferrari KC23's spare, sinuous purity in the pursuit of an iconic, futuristic design that will stand the test of time. When the driver turns on the engine before taking it out on the track, the KC23 undergoes a radical transformation, its racing stance and aggression suddenly very much to the fore. It is impossible to ignore its imposing rear wing, which marks it out as a racing car designed to scythe through the corners and unleash every single horsepower the V8 can generate.",
            "In terms of downforce and cooling, the designers worked hard to retain the performance of the donor car despite the fact that the KC23 has a completely different silhouette. Panels were developed with custom kinematics that activate automatically when the engine is turned on: the one behind the front wheel reveals a fence, which boosts front downforce to balance the car aerodynamically. The panel at the rear provides the correct amount of intake air to the intercoolers and auxiliary components, as well as to the engine.",
            "The Ferrari KC23's butterfly doors open vertically on single front hinges, an architectural solution it shares with another iconic supercar, the LaFerrari. No changes were required to the greenhouse or the car structurally to incorporate this feature. The clam-shell bonnet has a simple opening system - just two pins need to be removed to allow the front to be inspected and maintenance work to be done. Both headlights and rear lights have been redesigned, with the most radical change to the rear lights where striking methacrylate light blades, inspired by the Ferrari Vision Gran Turismo, spring to dazzling life when the engine is turned on.",
            "Even the car's glass surfaces were influenced by the design philosophy underpinning the KC23: they are seamlessly integrated with the bodywork, with no visible pillars, frames or seals, creating a clearly aeronautics-derived dome effect. Their metallic finish melds seamlessly for maximum styling continuity, creating a strikingly futuristic result.",
            "Another distinctive feature is the Ferrari KC23's Gold Mercury livery, courtesy of a specially-developed, four-layer aluminium paint. The liquid metal in the paint gives it an astonishingly luminous gleam in sunlight and the colour itself seems to change constantly depending on the type and angle of the light striking it, giving an extraordinarily captivating effect.",
            "The cabin has been kept as pared-back and similar to the 488 GT3 Evo 2020 as possible, with the exception of the door panels and dashboard finish on the passenger side. The KC23's specific seats, trimmed in Alcantara® with an electro-welded logo, lend the cabin an elegance that is perfectly in tune with the exterior. Rearward visibility is ensured by a video camera system that also had a beneficial impact on the car's aerodynamics, as the traditional wing mirrors could be removed and the line of the flanks left unsullied.",
            "The car has two sets of specifically designed wheels: 18\" wheels will allow the KC23 to dazzle on the world's circuits while 21\" wheels at the front and 22\" wheels at the rear will captivate the public when it is displayed in its static configuration.",
            "The new arrival took over three years to develop and now joins the most exclusive group in the Prancing Horse's range: bespoke cars crafted to the specifications of a client, making them the very pinnacle of Ferrari's personalisation strategy. It will be making its first public appearance at the 2023 Goodwood Festival of Speed, one of the UK's most important motorsports events. From August 1st to October 2nd, 2023, it will be on display at the Ferrari Museum in Maranello, much to the delight of all of the enthusiasts eager to admire its extraordinary formal and engineering solutions at first hand.",
            "SPECIAL PROJECTS",
            "The Special Projects programme is aimed at creating unique Ferraris (the so-called \"One-Offs\") characterised by an exclusive design crafted to the requirements of the client, who thus becomes the owner of a one-of-a-kind model. Each project originates from an idea put forward by the client and is developed hand-in-glove with a team of designers from Ferrari's Styling Centre. Once the car's proportion and forms have been defined, detailed design blueprints and a styling buck are produced before the manufacturing process for the new One-Off begins. The entire process takes around two years on average, during which time the client is closely involved in assessing the design and verification phases. The result? A unique Ferrari sporting the Prancing Horse logo and engineered to the same standards of excellence that characterise all of Maranello's cars."

            "In celebration of its 110th anniversary Aston Martin is proud to reveal Valour - a spectacular, ultra-exclusive V12-engined, manual transmission special edition built to honour the marque's long tradition of superlative front-engined sports cars and delight purists who crave undiluted and visceral driving experiences.",
            "Speaking of the thrilling new special edition, Aston Martin Executive Chairman, Lawrence Stroll said: \"Valour is a celebration of Aston Martin's passion for driving and extraordinary heritage, but it is also emblematic of today's vibrant and revitalised brand. A modern icon that fuses classic character with contemporary execution, Valour captures the essence of excitement and exclusivity that defines this storied automotive marque. A showcase for our world-class design, engineering and manufacturing capabilities, Valour is further proof of Aston Martin's position as the driver's champion and maker of the world's most exciting, exclusive and desirable ultra-luxury high-performance cars'.",
            "Aimed squarely at those who relish a truly involving driving experience, Valour's commitment to era-defining performance and stimulation is second to none. The only front-engined V12 sports car available with a manual transmission, its purist approach is unique in 2023 and a thrilling tribute to a golden era of driving.",
            "Motivated by this rich heritage, Aston Martin Valour has been realised using the very latest technology, methods and materials. As such it is a fusion of the essential qualities that have come to define Aston Martin's greatest front-engined models. Glorious throwback and contemporary masterpiece, Valour is the best of Aston Martin past and present and the antidote to cars that seek to isolate drivers from the process of driving.",
            "Aston Martin Valour's bloodline is second-to-none. Inspired by the original V8 Vantage and magnificent Vantage-based RHAM/1 'Muncher' Le Mans racer from 1980, it boasts the unbridled brawn so typical of Aston Martin's ultimate sports cars. Machines like the 1990s twin supercharged V600 Vantage; for a time the world's most powerful production car. Immaculate design and flawless execution echoes that of the exquisite One-77 supercar, while its intense driver-centric character connects Valour to the one-off Victor.",
            "With production limited to just 110 cars globally, Valour's rarity ensures it will be amongst the most collectable of all Aston Martins. A mouth-watering end-of-an-era specification - which mates the epic 715PS/753Nm twin-turbocharged 5.2-litre V12 to a bespoke six-speed manual transmission for the very first time - guarantees a truly absorbing experience and secures Valour's place in the pantheon of all-time great driver's cars.",
            "Benefitting from a unique powertrain calibration, Valour's immense power and torque outputs are unrestrained, offering the driver full performance and utmost control in every gear. A mechanical limited-slip differential enhances the sense of direct analogue connection between car and driver, with the added support and reassurance of electronic traction and stability control systems. Valour's Driving Modes - Sport, Sport+ and Track - have also been tuned to offer meticulously judged throttle response, torque management and sound character.",
            "Underlining its dynamic credentials Aston Martin Valour has received a bespoke suspension, with adaptive dampers, springs and anti-roll bars all honed specifically to the car. Wheel alignment geometry has dedicated camber, castor and toe settings. These characteristics ensure Valour possesses distinct and clearly defined ride and handling qualities. A road car first and foremost, this means successfully striking a sporting balance of taut, precise vertical body control and resolute resistance to roll, while offering the compliance to shine on great driving roads.",
            "Further honing its unique dynamic character, Valour's custom body structure features front and rear shear panels, a rear suspension tower strut brace and fuel tank bracing. These elements maximise both torsional and lateral stiffness, providing the suspension with an optimised platform in order to deliver more precise body control and increased refinement. In addition, a new steering system removes unwanted sources of compliance to give the driver even greater sense of detailed feel, connection and immediacy.",
            "With standard-fit Carbon Ceramic Brakes, Valour has ample stopping power courtesy of front discs measuring 410mm x 38mm and gripped by 6-piston calipers. At the rear 360mm x 32mm discs are paired with 4-piston calipers. Offering increased braking performance and a significant 23kg reduction in un-sprung mass versus steel brakes, these CCB discs are engineered to resist brake fade at temperatures up to 800 degrees, enabling the driver to explore Valour's full performance potential with maximum confidence and precise control.",
            "Completing Aston Martin Valour's impressive hardware package are a set of beautiful 21\" lightweight forged alloy 'Honeycomb' wheels, which are fitted with the very latest AML-specific Michelin Pilot Sport S 5 tyres - 275/35 R21 front tyres and 325/30 R21 on the rear - for inspired handling and road-holding in wet or dry conditions.",
            "Simon Newton, Aston Martin's Director of Vehicle Performance, said: \"Inspired by the iconic, muscle cars from our past, we have endowed Valour with an abundance of power and torque, while using modern technology and engineering to make that performance more exploitable and enjoyable. A big part of honouring that driver-pleasing character was mating our fabulous V12 engine to a manual transmission. It was a unique part of the brief and the end result is something truly unforgettable; a state-of-the-art driver's car that thrives on being pushed to its limits and has the true heart and soul of a timeless analogue classic'.",
            "Those immense performance capabilities and intense driving characteristics are vividly expressed in Aston Martin Valour's broad stance and highly developed physique. Made entirely from carbon fibre the bodywork marries Aston Martin's contemporary design language with instantly recognisable cues from the iconic 1970s V8 Vantage. The result is bold and unmistakable from any angle.",
            "The clamshell bonnet features a large 'horse shoe' vent and twin NACA ducts to provide ample ventilation for the twin-turbocharged V12 that sits beneath. Aston Martin's iconic grille shape has been evolved to enhance both form and function. Its central section is defined by aluminium strakes, while large carbon fibre intakes on either side feed the engine and brakes with cool air. They also frame the classically inspired round LED headlights, unique to Valour and which sit beneath rakish eyebrow-like grille with menacing effect.",
            "Modern aerodynamic thinking has been effortlessly incorporated into the design, with expert management of the airflow optimising stability while achieving a uniquely assertive design. The prominent front splitter and front fender vents incorporated into Valour's flanks work in harmony with the rear screen panel's featuring vortex generating exoblades, and elegantly upswept Kamm tail and prominent diffuser to achieve aerodynamic balance.",
            "The rear-end also features a dramatic tail-light graphic, with clusters of LED light blades (six on each side) echoing the ground-breaking Valkyrie hypercar. A full-width aluminium accent - milled from a solid billet and polished to a flawless finish - delineates the rear-end, separating the upper and lower sections to dramatic effect. Positioned between the deep elements of the rear diffuser is the centrepiece of Valour's extraordinary rear design; a triple tailpipe exhaust system fabricated from lightweight stainless steel. With a wall thickness of less than 1mm this special tubing makes a 7kg weight saving versus a traditional system, yet emits a gloriously heavyweight soundtrack.",
            "Valour's celebration of Aston Martin's heritage continues inside, with a timeless two-seater cockpit of uncommon simplicity and seductive tactility. Central to this is the manual transmission gear lever. With a choice of machined aluminium, titanium, carbon fibre or walnut for the gearknob, and an exposed shift mechanism to emphasise the mechanical connection, Valour majors on delivering the physical and emotional engagement that has been lost to progress.",
            "Masterful use of materials has long been an Aston Martin hallmark, so it's no surprise to find Valour's interior shines with original and highly effective combinations from which customers can create their own unique specification. For example, traditional woollen tweed inspired by the seat coverings of Aston Martin's 1959 Le Mans-winning DBR1 provide a wonderful contrast against the high-tech weave of carbon fibre used to form the shells of Valour's lightweight performance seats, bespoke door cards, fascia air vents, upper centre console and transmission tunnel.",
            "Further personalisation comes in the form of a flexible method of livery customisation. Separating Valour's body into four areas - front, bonnet, sides and rear - clients may choose from an extensive array of hand-painted stripes and graphics designs, which can be applied in any one of 21 paint colours.",
            "Should a customer wish to go beyond the standard palette of Valour options then they may engage the services of Q by Aston Martin to create a truly bespoke specification. Examples of this include design of a one-off livery, fully exposed 2x2 twill carbon fibre bodywork with a choice of red, blue or green tint, painted wheels, Mokume carbon fibre interior detailing or a choice of Johnsons of Elgin tweed and cashmere fabrics for the seats and headlining.",
            "Miles Nurnberger, Aston Martin's Director of Design, said: \"At Aston Martin our design is always progressive, but when it comes to celebrating a significant milestone - in this instance our 110th birthday - we allow ourselves a little latitude. Consequently, Valour is gloriously unapologetic; an old-school brute refined and reimagined through the lens of 2023. Making a return to a chiselled shape, moving away from the more sculptural forms that define current series production Aston Martin's, with bold details and modern materials root in the present. We were keen to ensure its looks reflect the driving experience. The raw physicality of the shape should tell you all you need to know about the ferocious performance and analogue thrills of taming a 715PS manual transmission sports car, yet the clear use of the latest technology points to a car with modern manners and exceptional dynamic capabilities\".",
            "Valour production is due to commence at Aston Martin's Gaydon Headquarters in Q3 of 2023, with first deliveries scheduled to begin during Q4 2023. Poised to become one of the most coveted cars in Aston Martin's unrivalled canon of iconic front-engined special series sports cars, Valour is a precious collector's piece that demands to be driven."

The all-new Envista is going to shake up that segment once again,\" said Duncan Aldred, global vice president, Buick-GMC. \"When you consider all the Envista has to offer, from its stunning design, standard technology and premium affordability, it's going to be hard to find a better package in that area of the market.\"",
            "The Buick Envista will be one of the most affordable SUVs in the segment, yet it will still come standard with high-quality materials, design and technologies.

This includes the new face of Buick, featuring a low-profile silhouette and forward leaning nose. The new Buick emblem is now proudly mounted on the body, directly above a sleek, intricate grille design. This design cue is taken from heritage vehicles of Buick's past.",
            "The body side of the vehicle encompasses sculptural beauty with powerful fender forms and a sculpted waistline that create the perception of fluid motion. Bright trim precisely incorporated around the glass adds to the vehicle's expressiveness by catching and reflecting light at different angles.",
            "The headlamps and taillamps evolve Buick's signature wing lighting with a thinner and more crisp form. LED checkmark lamps are mounted high on the fascia, while other functional lighting is lower on the body, creating a refined, layered look.",
            "\"The Envista represents a pure expression of Buick design,\" said Sharon Gauci, executive director, Global Buick-GMC Design. \"This is not your average small SUV.

Battista Edizione Nino Farina combines all these elements, with the phenomenal performance of the most powerful car ever made in Italy, the Battista. In our imagination, Nino would have dreamt to drive with his uncle Battista, pushing the car to its limits. As he did every time he raced. Driving this car will be an experience much like pulling on the suit of a superhero, an exceptional and emotional experience is assured. I look forward to personally presenting the Battista Edizione Nino Farina at Goodwood Festival of Speed this year.\"",
            "HONOURING A LEGEND",

            "As an uncle to Nino Farina, he was responsible for igniting the future World Champion's passion for motorsport. Battista took his 16-year-old nephew to participate in his first ever race, as a passenger. This established his appetite for competition and Nino went on to take part in numerous races and championships across Italy in the 1930s.",
            "In 1950, Nino Farina competed in the first Grand Prix races formally organised by the FIA - today's Formula One World Championship - leading a three-car team. In his first year of World Championship driving, Nino Farina won the British (the first to be held at Silverstone), Swiss and Italian races, taking the overall World Championship in the process.",
            "Nino Farina was a highly respected Formula One driver among his peers, noted for his fearless driving and passion for the sport - which contributed to his early F1 wins in his debut year. He led his teammates to a 1-2-3 finish at the very first race of 1950, at Silverstone, and completed the season by winning at the Italian Grand Prix in September.",

It is our tribute to a family dynasty - to the man who will forever be known as the first driver ever to be crowned a Formula One World Champion and to our founder, the man responsible for igniting his passion for racing. Each vehicle is a tribute to Nino's unrivalled history and each one represents a unique moment in his life, which was truly remarkable. We have taken inspiration from these moments to create a vehicle that would be the centre piece of any collection. Its signature Rosso Nino body colour has been chosen to evoke memories of the Italian racing red paintwork of the cars in which he enjoyed his greatest victories, while key finishes and design cues sit seamlessly with Battista's unmistakable design.\"",
            "The unique exterior design is finished in bespoke Rosso Nino - a deep and rich red hue that pays homage to the vehicles Nino Farina drove throughout his racing career.

            "To mark the 150th anniversary at the Audi site in Neckarsulm, twelve apprentices at the Four Rings electrified an iconic classic car. On July 8, 2023, trainees from the automotive mechatronics, bodywork, and vehicle construction mechanics and painting courses proudly unveiled the \"EP4\". The \"E\" stands for electric drive, and the \"P4\" for the NSU Prinz 4, a model produced in Neckarsulm by NSU Motorenwerke from 1961 to 1973.",
            "\"We wanted to build a car that was not only fast and looked cool but also honored the 150th-anniversary of the site,\" says Dean Scheuffler, an apprentice automotive mechanic at Audi in Neckarsulm. The perfect starting point: an NSU Prinz 4 built in 1971, which had been off the road for decades until its resurrection in January 2023. The apprentices awoke this \"prince\" from its slumber and fitted it with a new high-voltage heart.",
            "But it was a long roadfrom the project launch in January to the big reveal at the Family Day. In numerous team meetings, trainees, trainers, and project managers exchanged views on the project's status, challenges, and next steps. The first task was to create a solid foundation for the conversion. Mizgar Doman Hassan, an apprentice bodywork and vehicle construction mechanic, recalls: \"When we got the car, its body had several rust spots. These areas were the first thing we fixed.\"",
            "The drive: electrifying and emission-free",
            "While the budding body and paint specialists tackled the classic car's chassis and outer skin, the future automotive mechanics got to work on the powertrain, battery, and suspension.",
            "The rear of the \"prince,\" where a two-cylinder gasoline engine with 30 hp (22 kW) once resided, is now home to a 240 hp (176 kW) electric motor. It comes from a 2020 Audi e-tron and gets its power from a battery from the plug-in hybrid Audi Q7 TFSI e quattro.",
            "The battery sits under the front hood, where the NSU Prinz once had its fuel tank. The electrified machine breathes cooling air through a wide air intake at the bottom of the bumper, while heat can escape through a large opening in the front hood. The tailgate also improves cooling and can be fixed in a half-open position. Thus, it reveals the electric power plant and is reminiscent of historic racing cars based on the sporty NSU Prinz 1000. Where a row of open carburetor funnels gave onlookers clues about the sporting intentions of these cars back then, the EP4 now displays its electric motor.",
            "The exterior: athletic and historic",
            "For the apprentices, it was clear that their EP4 should proudly show that it began life as an NSU Prinz. The historic elements, therefore, include not only the front and rear lights. The body from the 1970s also retained its characteristic shoulder and roof lines. The apprentices freed the sheet metal from rust and painted it in Audi colors Suzuka Grey and Brilliant Black. Accents such as the anniversary lettering \"150\" were applied to the side of the vehicle.",
            "The big leap in performance required extensive modifications to the chassis and the bodywork. A modified floor pan from an Audi A1, including brakes and axles, forms the base. The apprentices mounted the extensively modified and significantly widened body on top. The muscular fenders are unmistakably athletic. The apprentices designed these with the support of Audi Design and turned them into reality using 3D printing. Wide wheels are tucked beneath the fenders. Thanks to modern performance tires, they provide the necessary grip during acceleration and sporty cornering.",
            "\"The eye travels with you! We wanted the EP4's performance to be visible from every angle,\" explains Cynthia Huster, apprentice automotive painter. The rear wing, painted Signal Yellow, gives the EP4 a particularly sporty appearance. The twist: The wing is not attached to the bodywork, as in other vehicles, but to the roll cage. Its supports, therefore go through the rear window.",
            "The interior: racing and minimalist",
            "The Signal Yellow roll cage makes for an eye-catching contrast in the interior. Apart from that, the interior - typical of racing cars - is reduced to the essentials; all other painted surfaces are black. The occupants sit on \"Recaro Podium\" bucket seats.",
            "A single-board computer and corresponding screen serve instruments and displays. They are also the vehicle's speedometer and onboard computer and perform diagnostic tasks.",
            "Talents work with passion and forward-looking technology",
            "In all the steps, the trainees put the knowledge they had acquired during their training to practical use. Timo Engler, Head of Training Vehicle Technology/Logistics, explains: \"The project gave our apprentices a chance to work freely with different techniques and materials. For example, in addition to the electric drive, they used 3D printing, a second technology of the future. Carbon fiber - familiar from motorsport - was also used for the front hood.",
            "But the trainees have not only learned a lot in terms of craftsmanship. Engler: \"In the case of EP4, the vision and deadline were very ambitious. It's great to see how the junior staff have grown with their task and what a leap in development they have made as a team.\"",
            "Last but not least, the trainees could get valuable tips and support from Audi's Technical Development anytime. In this way, they automatically learned a lot about Audi's processes and got to know various experts from other company branches.",
            "History meets the future",
            "Whether as symbols of the German \"Wirtschaftswunder\" (Miracle on the Rhine) or as racing cars that still score wins at hill climbs: NSU vehicles have made history and continue to inspire car enthusiasts to this day. With its charm and electric drivetrain, the EP4 stirs anticipation for the coming all-electric chapters in the continuing story of Audi's Neckarsulm site.",
            "Audi Board Member for Human Resources Xavier Ros was impressed with the unique project. \"With admirable commitment and considerable creativity, our apprentices have built a tremendous car. They can be really proud of the result,\" said Ros. He added: \" Projects like this show that our company has a strong future thanks to our young talent.\""

            "At 1990's Birmingham Motor Show, the 'S' model prefix that would go on to subtly convey the performance advantage held by a multitude of Audi models made its first appearance at the world debut of the S2. The performance flagship of the 80-based Coupé series was destined to succeed the original or 'Ur quattro', and featured an evolution of its characterful 2.2-litre turbocharged five-cylinder engine linked to a newly developed six-speed close ratio manual gearbox. At launch the Audi S2 Coupe delivered 220PS, but by the time our car was produced that had risen to 230PS thanks to extensive modifications, which also included the introduction of a turbocharger 'overboost' function giving the driver access to a torque increase from the quoted 309Nm to 350Nm for brief periods to maximise overtaking pace.",
            "Naturally, quattro all-wheel-drive underpinned the Audi S2's strong performance, and this of course was the latest iteration featuring a Torsen centre differential capable of varying front-to-rear torque distribution from 50:50 in normal operation to 75:25 or 25:75 depending on which axle had the most grip. In particularly testing conditions the rear differential could be locked manually.",

Regarded by many testers as the pick of the TT bunch, this Coupé-only special edition was limited to 1,000 UK specification examples, and was based on the 225PS version with its turbocharged four-cylinder engine.",
            "Engine modifications increased maximum power to 240PS and boosted peak torque from 280Nm to 320Nm. Weight was also optimised by replacing the spare wheel with a tyre mobility system, and the parcel shelf and rear seat with a strut brace for improved torsional rigidity.",
            "The detail changes shaved 49kg from the kerb weight, helping the Audi TT Coupé quattro Sport to touch 60mph from rest in less than six seconds, and to feel lighter on its feet on challenging roads, thanks also to suspension modifications. Naturally the TT's multi-plate clutch-based quattro system was on hand to instil maximum agility and control, while the upgraded braking system from the 3.2 quattro models provided appropriately reassuring stopping power.",
            "The special status of the Audi TT Coupé quattro Sport was reflected visually in its unique two-tone paint finish, and by an aerodynamic sports styling package donated by the 3.2 quattro models. Inside, a more purposeful air was created by special Recaro bucket seats trimmed in leather and Alcantara, which also wrapped the steering wheel, gear knob and hand brake grip.",

For example, larger turbochargers and an increase in boost pressure from 2.4 to 2.6 bar in the 4.0-litre V8 biturbo TFSI engine that both the RS6 Avant performance and RS7 Sportback performance boast, allow an increase of 30PS in engine power and 50Nm more torque compared to the outgoing versions. This means a total increase in power from 600PS to 630PS and in maximum torque from 800Nm to 850Nm. The performance models sprint from 0-62mph in 3.4 seconds, 0.2 seconds faster than the outgoing RS6 / RS7 base versions.",

For example, the coasting mode now only activates automatically in the efficiency profile, which means in speed ranges up to 99mph, it switches off the combustion engine and coasts with no fuel consumption or drag torque from the engine. Additionally, fine-tuning to the engine control unit software makes for tighter load changes in S mode when the \"dynamic\" drive select mode or driving mode S is active. The updated software in the transmission control unit makes for faster shifting times and a noticeably increased spread between the various driving modes.",

            "Mercedes-Benz is continuing its long tradition of sporty, elegant dream cars with a new, independent series. The new CLE Coupé uses the conceptual and technical innovations of the C-Class and E-Class. With its expressive design, exclusive comfort equipment for maximum individuality and confident, sporty driving performance, the new two-door car goes its own way. The market launch of the Mercedes-Benz CLE Coupé will start in Europe in November 2023. The CLE Cabriolet will follow next year for open-air connoisseurs. With the new dream car series, Mercedes-Benz is fulfilling the wishes of many customers in the C-and E-Class segments.",
            "Iconic design",
            "Long wheelbase, a well-positioned and strongly inclined A-pillar, a short front and a slightly longer rear body overhang, as well as pronounced shoulders and large wheels. There has always been a special magic inherent in these proportions - and they are inextricably linked to the Mercedes-Benz brand. The new CLE Coupé combines these sporty, elegant proportions with the modern design language of Mercedes-Benz. True to the Mercedes-Benz design philosophy of Sensual Purity, the result is a sculpture full of power and dynamism that embodies an emotional statement from every perspective.",
            "Athletic appearance",
            "The progressively forward-leaning front section (\"shark nose\") with a low-slung bonnet, flat LED headlights with a unique design and the newly designed, three-dimensional radiator grille ensure an athletic yet extremely elegant appearance. The strongly contoured power domes on the long hood refer to the powerful engines with up to six cylinders. In the side view, a distinctive shaped edge structures the powerful volume. This character line runs from the headlight to the exterior mirror and from the rear light to the door handle. The muscular rear is characterised by flowing surfaces, smooth transitions and two-part LED lights with new contours and three-dimensional light bodies.",
            "Plenty of space",
            "At 4,850 millimetres long, 1,860 millimetres wide and 1,428 millimetres high, the new two-door is the largest coupé in the mid-size segment. With its dimensional concept - in particular the 25 millimetre longer wheelbase - the CLE Coupé offers significantly more space than the C-Class Coupé. The rear passengers in particular benefit from 10 millimetres more headroom, 19 millimetres more shoulder and elbow room and 72 millimetres more knee room. The trunk volume offers 60 litres more volume and can easily hold three golf bags.",
            "Sporty luxury",
            "Eye-catchers in the interior are the free-standing 12.3-inch, fully digital instrument display, the 11.9-inch, driver-oriented central display in user-friendly portrait format and the dynamic ambient lighting featuring 64 colours. If desired, it can extend from the centre console to beneath the outer air vents. In each of the doors, a strip of light runs along the contours of the armrest and beltline to the rear. Another highlight is the front seats in integral sport design, developed exclusively for the CLE. In conjunction with the optional Burmester® 3D surround sound system, they each have two loudspeakers at the level of the headrests and thus create a particularly individual and immersive music experience with Dolby Atmos and Spatial Audio close to the ears.",
            "Specific EASY-ENTRY function",
            "For the first time at Mercedes-Benz, the front seats are not unlocked using a lever, but instead with an elegant loop made of Nappa leather. It is conveniently located at the upper edge of the backrest.",
            "Latest MBUX generation",
            "The Mercedes-Benz CLE Coupé adopts numerous digital innovations from the new E-Class. With the new electronics architecture and the third generation of the MBUX infotainment system, it is the most intelligent coupé with the star. It offers an exceptionally interactive entertainment experience with third-party apps and a new level of personalisation with automated convenience functions (routines).",
            "Electrified driving experience",
            "The new CLE Coupé sets standards in efficiency thanks to systematic electrification and intelligent downsizing. All engines are mild hybrids with an integrated starter generator and 48-volt electrical system. There is a choice of four-cylinder units and - as the most powerful engine - a 3.0-litre straight-six petrol engine.",
            "Sporty and comfortable driving pleasure",
            "The chassis is lowered by 15 millimetres as standard. The optional DYNAMIC BODY CONTROL, with continuously adjustable damping on the front and rear axles in combination with rear-axle steering, both offered in the Technology package, ensures particularly agile and at the same time comfortable driving pleasure. The steering angle is up to 2.5 degrees. This reduces the turning circle by 50 centimetres. Despite its larger dimensions, the CLE Coupé with rear-wheel drive has a smaller turning circle than the C-Class Coupé (10.7 instead of 11.2 metres).",
            "Extensive safety",
            "Numerous driver assistance systems, some of which have been further developed, offer situation-specific support for more safety. The extensive standard equipment includes ATTENTION ASSIST, Active Brake Assist, Active Lane Keeping Assist, Speed Limit Assist, and the parking package with reversing camera. In Western Europe, Active Distance Assist DISTRONIC is also standard equipment.",
            "The exterior design",
            "The new Mercedes-Benz CLE Coupé embodies an emotional statement from every perspective. The sporty, elegant two-door unites proportions typical of a coupé with the modern design language of Mercedes-Benz, whose aesthetic soul is shaped by the design philosophy of Sensual Purity. This creates a sculptural appearance for the CLE Coupé, which is characterised by flowing surfaces with seamless transitions. The progressive dynamics and elegance come into their own when viewed from the side: thanks to the combination of a low silhouette (1,428 mm) with a long wheelbase (2,865 mm), short overhangs (888 mm at the front/1,097 mm at the rear) and a particularly muscular shoulder the two-door fills the road. Other typical coupé features are the long bonnet embedded in the front end with two powerful power domes, the steeply sloping windscreen and the long, sloping roof towards the rear. The passenger cell, which is set far back, leads to the sporty, short rear via the rear window, which is also set flat.",
            "A distinctive shaped edge structures the powerful volume in the side wall. This character line runs from the headlight to the exterior mirror and from the rear light to the door handle. It emphasises the sporty proportions and the powerful wheel arches. In addition, the shaped edge, together with the chrome-rimmed side windows, underlines the balance between elegance and dynamics. The basic variant AVANTGARDE Line rolls on 18-inch light-alloy wheels as standard. With the AMG Line, 19-inch rims are standard. A large selection of other light-alloy wheels in 18 to 20 inches and ten different exterior colours enable a high degree of customisation.",
            "Expressive front: newly designed three-dimensional radiator grille",
            "The progressively forward-leaning front section (\"shark nose\") with a low-slung bonnet, flat LED headlights with a unique design and a distinctive radiator grille ensure a decidedly athletic yet extremely elegant appearance. The strongly contoured power domes on the long hood reference the powerful engines with up to six cylinders. As is typical for coupés, the radiator grille has a single louvre in glossy black with chrome trim and a central star. Behind it shines a grille in a newly designed, three-dimensional chrome look with a Mercedes-Benz pattern. The downward-opening silhouette of the radiator grille (A-shape design) also emphasises the powerful forward drive of the Mercedes-Benz CLE Coupé. Together with the chrome frame around the shiny black central air intake in the front apron, it makes the two-door look lower and nestle closer to the road.",
            "The CLE Coupé has LED High Performance headlights with a newly designed trifunctional torch for daytime running lights, position lights and direction indicators as standard. DIGITAL LIGHT headlights with and without projection function are available as special equipment. They have two daytime running light ellipses and blue illumination of the headlight base for an unmistakable look that further reinforces the dynamic appearance.",
            "Powerful rear: Distinctive LED lights with three-dimensional light bodies",
            "The powerful rear is characterised by flowing surfaces and smooth transitions. Another highlight is the two-part LED lights with new contours and three-dimensional light bodies. Optionally, a light show to welcome and say goodbye to the passengers is available. The rear lights are connected with a dark red design element. Like the classic chrome trim strip on the bumper, it emphasises the width of the rear. In the AVANTGARDE Line, C-shaped trim parts enclose the chrome trim strip like a classy clasp.",
            "The dimensional concept: the largest coupé in its segment",
            "With its dimensional concept, the Mercedes-Benz CLE Coupé is in a league of its own. At 4,850 millimetres long, 1,860 millimetres wide and 1,428 millimetres high, the new two-door is significantly larger than the C-Class Coupé, but two millimetres flatter and 15 millimetres longer than the E-Class Coupé.",
            "The interior design",
            "Sporty luxury in a class of its own, focused fully on the driver: this is the concept for the interior design of the new CLE Coupé. Eye-catchers in the cockpit are the free-standing 12.3-inch (21.3 cm) fully digital instrument display and the 11.9-inch (30.2 cm) central display in user-friendly portrait format. It grows seamlessly out of the front, glossy jet-black area of the centre console and has a six-degree incline towards the driver's seat. Together with the vertical format, this creates a visual dynamic and lightness that underlines the sporty claim and the pronounced driver orientation of the CLE Coupé.",
            "Additional sportiness is created by the dynamic ambient lighting in 64 colours. Ambient lighting with indirect light on the trim strip of the instrument panel, the cup holders on the centre console, the overhead control unit, the door handles, the seat adjustment unit and in the front footwell is standard equipment. With the optional Ambient Lighting Plus, a light band sweeps from the centre console along the lower edge of the instrument panel to beneath the outer air vents on each side. A strip of light runs in each of the doors along the lines of the armrest and beltline to the rear row of seats, which reinforces the generous feeling of space.",
            "Individual music experience with integrated speakers in the seat",
            "Other highlights include the standard multi-function sports steering wheel in leather and new front seats developed exclusively for the CLE. They feature an avant-garde sports seat design with integrated headrests. In conjunction with the optional Burmester® 3D surround sound system, they each have two speakers at the level of the headrests, creating a particularly individual and immersive music experience with Dolby Atmos close to the ears. The premium sound system has a total of 17 speakers.",
            "The sporty integral seat look of the new multi-contour seats reinforces the reduced design with three-dimensional, seamless shapes on the instrument panel and in the doors - giving the interior an additional visual lightness. The front seats are heated and have an electro-pneumatic four-way lumbar support as standard. Seat climate control and a seven-zone massage are also available in conjunction with the optional ENERGIZING Plus package. Seat height, backrest and cushion inclination, as well as seat cushion depth, can be infinitely adjusted electrically. The memory function can be used to save individual driver seat settings for up to three people - as can the position of the steering wheel, the optional head-up display and the exterior mirrors. If the driver changes, the optimal driving position can be conveniently set at the touch of a button.",
            "User interface: pixel perfect in the best operating architecture",
            "The display graphics and their arrangement are taken from the C-Class. The styles \"Classic\", \"Sport\" and \"Ambiente\" can therefore also be selected in the Mercedes-Benz CLE Coupé and are optionally supplemented by a full-screen map in the instrument cluster. All relevant settings for media, vehicle, telephone, comfort, etc. can be experienced directly and intuitively on the central display. The new main icons in the central display are immediately recognisable as modernisation. They were only recently introduced in the new E-Class.",
            "EASY-ENTRY with elegant leather strap",
            "A new, specific EASY-ENTRY function ensures easy access to the rear. The front seats are not unlocked with a lever, but with an elegant loop made of Nappa leather. It is conveniently located at the upper edge of the backrest. Anyone who has not buckled their seat belt immediately after boarding can reactivate the seat belt feeder via a button on the central display or simply by opening and closing the door again. In addition, the CLE Coupé is one of the first Mercedes-Benz vehicles with an optimised warning if the seat belt is not fastened. The system only reacts to seats on which someone who has not buckled their seat belt is actually sitting.",
            "The KEYLESS-GO comfort package is available to further increase convenience. In addition to starting the engine at the push of a button, it enables all vehicle doors to be opened and locked by simply touching the respective door handle. The recessed grips are illuminated for better orientation in the dark. With HANDS-FREE ACCESS, the trunk can also be opened and closed contact-free and fully automatically - with a simple kick of the foot in the rear bumper's sensor area.",
            "Exclusive materials and colours",
            "One of the most customer-friendly features of the new CLE Coupé is the wide range of customisation options. This includes the exclusive selection of colours and high-quality materials. In the AVANTGARDE Line standard equipment, the seats are upholstered in black ARTICO man-made leather. The AMG Line comes standard with ARTICO/MICROCUT black, which is made of 65 percent recycled materials in the seat area and 85 percent in the inner lining. Alternatively, the colours macchiato beige/black and tonka brown/black are available. Seats in leather with elaborate longitudinal piping and in Nappa leather with quilted, perforated diamond shapes are optionally available. The colour selection ranges from black to macchiato beige/black, tonka brown/black and power red/black to white/black. The leather covers come from sustainable processing, made with plant-based tanning agents.",
            "In the AMG Line, the instrument panel and beltlines are covered as standard in black ARTICO man-made leather with a Nappa look (optional extra for AVANTGARDE Line). A wide range of trim parts with innovative, technoid or natural surfaces expands the sensory experience between traditional and digital luxury. The highlight is a new trim part with a silver-coloured mixed-metal fabric. Due to its high-gloss finish, it looks very futuristic. A similarly innovative feature is an open-pored, black wood veneer that is interspersed with fine real aluminium inlays. The other trim elements include open-pore brown walnut wood, open-pore anthracite linestructure lime wood and AMG carbon fibre. In the basic configuration, the Mercedes-Benz CLE Coupé comes with silver-grey diamond-pattern trim (AVANTGARDE Line) or metal structure (AMG Line).",
            "Generous space",
            "With its dimensional concept - in particular the 25-millimetre longer wheelbase - the CLE Coupé offers significantly more space than the C-Class Coupé. The rear passengers in particular benefit from 10 millimetres more headroom, 19 millimetres more shoulder and elbow room and 72 millimetres more knee room. The trunk offers 60 litres more volume and can easily hold three golf bags.",
            "The infotainment and comfort experience",
            "The CLE Coupé adopts numerous digital innovations from the new E-Class. After the business sedan, it is the second vehicle with the new electronic architecture and the third generation of the MBUX (Mercedes-Benz User Experience) infotainment system. This makes the sporty two-door the most intelligent coupé with the star. It reaches a new dimension of personalisation and interaction.

This type of networking increases performance. Data streams can be transmitted faster. Depending on the market, a communication module with 5G is used as the transmission technology. Significantly higher data rates are possible with the 5G mobile communications standard than with LTE/UMTS.",
            "The entertainment programme in the Mercedes-Benz CLE Coupé is extraordinarily interactive - for an individual digital experience. A new Android compatibility layer allows the installation of third-party apps. The following apps will be available at market launch: the entertainment platform \"TikTok\", the podcast platform \"Pocket Casts\", the audio and video streaming platform \"Audials\", the game \"Angry Birds\", the cloud-based collaboration application \" Webex\", the video conferencing system \"Zoom\" and the internet browser \"Vivaldi\". In addition, the entertainment portal ZYNC is on board as an option. It offers video streaming, on-demand content, interactive experiences, local video programming, sports, news and much more. More than 30 streaming services from renowned global, regional and local partners are already available. Other partners and channels are constantly being integrated. The Mercedes me Store has a new App Store. The offer will be gradually expanded. In this way, the dream car is always up-to-date and can be extensively personalised.",
            "Online Music: music streaming with millions of songs to choose from",
            "The MBUX entertainment package is optionally available from the Mercedes me Store. It includes Internet radio, music streaming and a data package from a selected third-party provider. With the \"Online Music\" service, Mercedes-Benz has fully integrated the largest music streaming providers - Tidal, Spotify, Amazon Music and Apple Music - into the MBUX infotainment system. MBUX enables access to the personal user profile of the linked music providers. This is how the customer gets their favourite songs and playlists and discovers millions of songs and curated playlists.",
            "Hey Mercedes: powerful and learning language assistant",
            "By activating online services in the Mercedes me App, the Hey Mercedes language assistant is highly capable of dialogue and learning. With the \"Just Talk\" function, the intelligent voice control can now also be activated without the keyword \"Hey Mercedes\". The customer must be alone in the vehicle for this. When the function is activated, a red microphone symbol appears in the display. Then the CLE Coupé is ready and waiting for voice commands.",
            "Hey Mercedes also explains vehicle functions and helps, for example, if you want to connect your smartphone via Bluetooth. If compatible building technology and household appliances are available, these can also be networked with the CLE Coupé thanks to the Smart Home function and controlled from the vehicle by voice. The language assistant can also recognise occupants acoustically. After the individual voice characteristics have been learned, this can be used to access personal data and functions via profile activation.",
            "Personalisation: easy and comfortable",
            "Customers can create their personal profile directly in the Mercedes-Benz CLE Coupé and synchronise it with existing profile data in the Mercedes me account. By scanning a QR code with the Mercedes me app, the vehicle is automatically connected to the Mercedes me account. Up to seven different profiles with a total of around 800 parameters are possible in the vehicle. For example, the ambient lighting can be set individually from home via remote configuration. Personal preferences such as your favourite radio station and default settings can be taken into the car via your own Mercedes me profile.",
            "Since the profiles are stored in the cloud as part of Mercedes me, they can also be used in other Mercedes-Benz vehicles with the corresponding MBUX generations. In addition to the classic entry of a PIN, a special authentication procedure ensures a high level of security. Fingerprint and voice recognition are combined. At the same time, this enables individual settings to be called up and digital payment processes to be secured from the vehicle. The fingerprint scanner is ergonomically located in the menu bar below the central display.",
            "Next level of personalisation: routines automate comfort functions based on personal needs",
            "Mercedes-Benz is working on automating comfort functions using artificial intelligence (AI). The vehicle should learn which comfort systems the driver uses repeatedly at certain times and under certain conditions, and then run them automatically. The apps for navigation, radio and telephone are already proposing concrete actions. For example, a telephone number or a navigation destination that is dialed regularly at a specific point in time. In addition, more than 20 other functions - from ENERGIZING COMFORT to birthday reminders to suggestions for the to-do list - are automatically offered with the help of AI if they are relevant to the driver. Mercedes-Benz calls these functions \"Magic Module\". They are displayed on MBUX's so-called zero-layer interface.",
            "The Mercedes-Benz CLE Coupé goes one step further in terms of automated adaptation to personal habits. The sporty two-door adopts the innovative routines introduced with the new E-Class. At the market launch, customers can use templates of standard routines. They also have the option of creating their own routines. You can link several functions and conditions with each other.",

            "ENERGIZING Coach: The right programme recommendation for every mood",
            "The ENERGIZING COACH is based on an intelligent algorithm. Depending on the situation and the individual, it recommends one of the programmes Freshness, Warmth, Vitality or Joy. If the Mercedes-Benz vivoactive® 3 smartwatch, the Mercedes-Benz Venu® smartwatch or another compatible Garmin® wearable is integrated, personal values such as heart rate, stress level or sleep quality optimise the accuracy of the recommendation. The Mercedes me ENERGIZING App transmits the vital data of the wearer to the ENERGIZING COACH via smartwatch. The recommended comfort programme can be started directly via a message (\"Notification\") on the MBUX central display. The aim is to feel good even on demanding or rather monotonous journeys and to arrive relaxed. In addition, the heart rate is transmitted from the integrated Garmin® wearable to the central display.",
            "The ENERGIZING Package Plus is optionally available for the CLE Coupé. It offers a comprehensive experience with ENERGIZING COMFORT, ENERGIZING COACH, AIR BALANCE package for scenting, ionising and cleaning the air, seat climate control for the front seats and ambient lighting with programme-specific lighting moods.

            "The sound systems",
            "There are three sound systems to choose from in the new Mercedes-Benz CLE Coupé. The top equipment is the optional Burmester® 3D surround sound system. It takes the immersive audio experience to a new level with native integration of spatial audio with Dolby Atmos. Audio surrounds the driver and passengers with unparalleled multi-dimensional spaciousness and clarity that virtually transports them to a recording studio or live stage. Dolby Atmos allows individual instruments or voices to be placed around the listening area. This allows a new kind of sound animation. While conventional stereo systems tend to have left-right dynamics, Dolby Atmos can use the full range and create a 360-degree experience. The Burmester® 3D surround sound system features 17 speakers, including two close to each ear in the front seats.",
            "In the new CLE Coupé, Mercedes-Benz customers who have an Apple Music subscription have access to an ever-growing selection of songs and albums that are available in spatial audio with Dolby Atmos. Universal Music Group (UMG) is the first music label to proactively encourage its artists to produce music in Dolby Atmos. With this new audio standard, the world's largest music label enables them to base their song approval processes on how the final mix sounds in a Mercedes-Benz. For this purpose, UMG has introduced the new seal \"Approved in a Mercedes-Benz\" as the \"gold\" standard for the implementation of Dolby Atmos in vehicles.",
            "The drive",
            "Thanks to consistent electrification and intelligent downsizing, the new CLE Coupé sets standards in efficiency. The range of engines includes four-cylinder units and a six-cylinder engine from the current modular Mercedes-Benz engine family FAME (Family of Modular Engines). Both the diesel and petrol engines are mild hybrids. In addition to a turbocharger, they have a second-generation integrated starter generator (ISG). It provides support in the low-speed range and ensures excellent power development.",
            "The ISG includes the 48-volt vehicle electrical system. It ensures functions such as coasting, boost or recuperation and thus enables significant savings in consumption. Another advantage: the engines start very quickly and conveniently. As a result, the start-stop function is almost imperceptible, as is the transition from coasting with the engine switched off to powerful propulsion with engine power. When idling, the intelligent interaction of the ISG with the combustion engine ensures outstanding smoothness. Thanks to a new battery, the power of the electric motor has been increased from 15 to 17 kW compared to other series. The boost torque is 200 Nm.",
            "Plug-in hybrid under development",
            "Mercedes-Benz will also offer the CLE Coupé as a plug-in hybrid at a later date. In purely electric driving mode, the vehicle will offer a practical range. The driving programme will provide the electric driving mode for the most sensible sections of the route. For example, electric driving will be given priority on routes in urban areas.",
            "Gasoline: Innovative four and six-cylinder engines",
            "The most powerful engine is the 3.0-litre straight-six (M 256 M). The combination of twin-scroll turbocharger and ISG ensures excellent power delivery without turbo lag. The exhaust ducts of three cylinders each are combined in the dual-flow exhaust manifold and only rejoin directly in front of the turbine wheel. This leads to a spontaneous build-up of boost pressure and torque as well as rapid engine response and revving at low engine speeds. The CLE 450 4MATIC develops 280 kW (381 hp) and 500 Nm of torque and thus achieves the sportiest driving performance.",
            "The four-cylinder petrol engine (M 254) is available in two output levels at market launch: with 150 kW as the CLE 200 and CLE 200 4MATIC and with 190 kW as the CLE 300 4MATIC. The entry displacement is 2.0 litres. In this engine, Mercedes-Benz has combined all the innovations of the modular engine family FAME in one unit. These include the NANOSLIDE® cylinder coating, the CONICSHAPE® cylinder honing (trumpet honing), the segment turbocharger with variable flow connection and the exhaust gas aftertreatment placed directly on the engine. The M 254 with 150 kW works with the Miller combustion process to further increase efficiency. The intake valve already closes during the intake stroke. This reduces the gas temperature after compression. This leads to a higher thermal efficiency and thus to a more efficient use of the fuel. In addition, fewer pollutants are produced, in particular the proportion of nitrogen oxides is lower. The 190 kW power variant also has CAMTRONIC with two-stage valve lift switching.",
            "Diesel: four-cylinder engine with variable turbine geometry",
            "Under the hood of the CLE 220 d Coupé is the four-cylinder OM 654 M diesel engine. It is powered by a single-stage exhaust gas turbocharger with variable turbine geometry and friction-optimised roller bearing. The turbocharger is tuned so that the engine responds quickly and develops its power harmoniously. The electrification also includes the use of an electric refrigerant compressor for the air conditioning system. Exhaust aftertreatment includes a close-coupled NOx storage catalytic converter, a diesel particulate filter with a special coating (DPF), an SCR catalytic converter and an additional SCR catalytic converter in the vehicle's underbody.",
            "Transmission: Advanced nine-speed automatic",
            "The 9G-TRONIC transmission was further developed for the adaptation of the ISG and is used in all CLE models. The electric motor, the power electronics and the transmission cooler have been moved into or onto the transmission. The lines that were previously required are no longer required, which offers advantages in terms of installation space and weight. In addition, the efficiency of the transmission has been increased. Among other things, the optimised interaction with the electric auxiliary oil pump has made it possible to reduce the delivery volume of the mechanical pump by 30 percent compared to its predecessor - good for efficiency. In addition, a new generation of fully integrated transmission control with a multi-core processor and new assembly and connection technology is used. In addition to the increased computing power, the number of electrical interfaces has been drastically reduced and the weight of the transmission control has been reduced by 30 percent compared to its predecessor.",
            "The 4MATIC all-wheel drive has also been further developed. With the front-axle drive, higher torques can be transmitted and axle load distributions that are ideal in terms of driving dynamics can be achieved. In addition, there is a significant weight advantage compared to the corresponding component of the previous series. Less weight contributes to CO2 reduction.",
            "The suspension",
            "The suspension of the new Mercedes-Benz CLE Coupé enables agile driving fun on winding roads. At the same time, it offers exceptional driving comfort over long distances. The precise guidance of the front wheels on four links each plays a large part in the dynamic handling. On the rear axle, a multi-link construction with a five-link concept ensures good wheel control qualities and straight-line stability. There are three chassis variants to choose from. Compared to the sedan series, they are lowered by 15 millimetres as standard - for a more dynamic appearance.",
            "The standard equipment is the comfort suspension with lowering. It combines supreme driving comfort and sporty directness. Rolling behaviour, damping effect and stabilisation are continuously and automatically adapted to the surface. A sports suspension with an amplitude-selective damping system is available as an option. It offers a stiffer suspension and damping design as well as sports direct steering for more direct handling and agility. When cornering quickly or when making quick evasive manoeuvres, this sporty chassis tuning is noticeable in the form of less body roll.",
            "DYNAMIC BODY CONTROL with continuously adjustable damping individually for each wheel",
            "The technology package is available as an option for the CLE Coupé. It includes the DYNAMIC BODY CONTROL suspension with continuously adjustable damping on the front and rear axles as well as rear-axle steering. The active chassis controls the damping characteristics in conjunction with the engine, transmission and steering properties for each wheel individually - to suit the driving situation, speed and road surface conditions. The driver can use the DYNAMIC SELECT switch to choose between a comfortable or a sporty, taut setting. In conjunction with DYNAMIC BODY CONTROL, the CLE Coupé is equipped with sports direct steering. It combines a variable ratio that depends on the steering angle for precisely agile reactions with speed-dependent electromechanical power assistance for pleasantly smooth handling.",
            "Rear axle steering for even more agility",
            "With rear-axle steering and the associated more direct steering ratio on the front axle, the Mercedes-Benz CLE Coupé is particularly agile and stable at the same time. The steering angle on the rear axle is up to 2.5 degrees. This reduces the turning circle by 50 centimetres. In the models with 4MATIC it is 11.2 instead of 11.7 metres. In the rear-wheel drive versions, the turning circle is reduced from 11.2 to 10.7 metres. Despite its larger dimensions, the CLE Coupé with rear-wheel drive has a smaller turning circle than the C-Class Coupé (11.2 metres). In addition, thanks to the more direct steering ratio, the driver needs fewer turns of the steering wheel to turn it fully.",
            "At speeds below 60 km/h, the rear wheels steer in the opposite direction to the front wheels. The wheelbase is thus virtually shortened depending on the situation, making the vehicle more manoeuvrable, light-footed and agile. From a speed of 60 km/h, the rear wheels steer in the same direction as the front wheels. The resulting virtual longer wheelbase offers noticeable advantages: increased driving stability and driving safety at high speeds, fast lane changes or sudden evasive manoeuvres. In addition, significantly fewer steering angles have to be applied during dynamic manoeuvres. The CLE Coupé reacts more sportily to steering commands. This is supported by the integrated driving dynamics control of the ESP®.",
            "The driver assistance systems",
            "The standard equipment of the CLE Coupé includes ATTENTION ASSIST, Active Brake Assist, Active Lane Keeping Assist, Speed Limit Assist and the parking package with reversing camera. In Western Europe, Active Distance Assist DISTRONIC is also standard equipment. It aids the driver by adapting the speed to slower vehicles ahead. The desired target distance can be set in several stages. The status and activity of all driving assistance systems are shown full screen in the assistance display of the driver's display.",
            "Other driver assistance systems are part of equipment packages. The Advanced Plus package also includes Blind Spot Assist and Traffic Sign Assist. The premium package includes the parking package with 360-degree camera and DIGITAL LIGHT.",
            "The Driving Assistance Package Plus with extended functionality",
            "The Driving Assistance Package Plus is available as special equipment. It includes more than ten latest-generation assistance and safety systems.",
            "The parking systems: Faster into the space",
            "The Active Parking Assist PARKTRONIC has been improved in several respects: The starting process can now be performed intuitively via the central display. In addition, it is much faster to automatically park in and drive out than before. At the same time, the warning tones are omitted during the parking process. Active Parking Assist is part of the optional Parking Package with 360-degree Camera.",
            "The Memory Park Assistant (SAE Level 2) is also available for the Mercedes-Benz CLE Coupé. It can remember parking processes such as the arrival to and departure from the garage at home. The driver sits at the wheel and performs the parking process once. If the vehicle approaches the learned starting position, the parking process can be conveniently started via the central display. The driver monitors the parking process. If obstacles are registered, the vehicle stops until they are removed. The Memory Park Assistant can remember individual parking processes at up to five different locations. You can learn how to park in and drive out of a parking space at any location, up to a maximum of 100 metres in each case. Memory Park Assist is available in conjunction with the Driver Assistance Package Plus or the Parking Package with 360 Camera."

Dolby Atmos allows individual instruments or voices to be placed around the listening area. This allows a new kind of sound animation. While conventional stereo systems tend to have left-right dynamics, Dolby Atmos can use the full range and create a 360-degree experience. The Burmester® 3D surround sound system features 17 speakers, including two close to each ear in the front seats.",
            "In the new CLE Coupé, Mercedes-Benz customers who have an Apple Music subscription have access to an ever-growing selection of songs and albums that are available in spatial audio with Dolby Atmos. Universal Music Group (UMG) is the first music label to proactively encourage its artists to produce music in Dolby Atmos. With this new audio standard, the world's largest music label enables them to base their song approval processes on how the final mix sounds in a Mercedes-Benz. For this purpose, UMG has introduced the new seal \"Approved in a Mercedes-Benz\" as the \"gold\" standard for the implementation of Dolby Atmos in vehicles.",
            "The drive",
            "Thanks to consistent electrification and intelligent downsizing, the new CLE Coupé sets standards in efficiency. The range of engines includes four-cylinder units and a six-cylinder engine from the current modular Mercedes-Benz engine family FAME (Family of Modular Engines). Both the diesel and petrol engines are mild hybrids. In addition to a turbocharger, they have a second-generation integrated starter generator (ISG). It provides support in the low-speed range and ensures excellent power development.",
            "The ISG includes the 48-volt vehicle electrical system. It ensures functions such as coasting, boost or recuperation and thus enables significant savings in consumption. Another advantage: the engines start very quickly and conveniently. As a result, the start-stop function is almost imperceptible, as is the transition from coasting with the engine switched off to powerful propulsion with engine power. When idling, the intelligent interaction of the ISG with the combustion engine ensures outstanding smoothness. Thanks to a new battery, the power of the electric motor has been increased from 15 to 17 kW compared to other series. The boost torque is 200 Nm.",
            "Plug-in hybrid under development",
            "Mercedes-Benz will also offer the CLE Coupé as a plug-in hybrid at a later date. In purely electric driving mode, the vehicle will offer a practical range. The driving programme will provide the electric driving mode for the most sensible sections of the route. For example, electric driving will be given priority on routes in urban areas.",
            "Gasoline: Innovative four and six-cylinder engines",
            "The most powerful engine is the 3.0-litre straight-six (M 256 M). The combination of twin-scroll turbocharger and ISG ensures excellent power delivery without turbo lag. The exhaust ducts of three cylinders each are combined in the dual-flow exhaust manifold and only rejoin directly in front of the turbine wheel. This leads to a spontaneous build-up of boost pressure and torque as well as rapid engine response and revving at low engine speeds. The CLE 450 4MATIC develops 280 kW (381 hp) and 500 Nm of torque and thus achieves the sportiest driving performance.",
            "The four-cylinder petrol engine (M 254) is available in two output levels at market launch: with 150 kW as the CLE 200 and CLE 200 4MATIC and with 190 kW as the CLE 300 4MATIC. The entry displacement is 2.0 litres. In this engine, Mercedes-Benz has combined all the innovations of the modular engine family FAME in one unit. These include the NANOSLIDE® cylinder coating, the CONICSHAPE® cylinder honing (trumpet honing), the segment turbocharger with variable flow connection and the exhaust gas aftertreatment placed directly on the engine. The M 254 with 150 kW works with the Miller combustion process to further increase efficiency. The intake valve already closes during the intake stroke. This reduces the gas temperature after compression. This leads to a higher thermal efficiency and thus to a more efficient use of the fuel. In addition, fewer pollutants are produced, in particular the proportion of nitrogen oxides is lower. The 190 kW power variant also has CAMTRONIC with two-stage valve lift switching.",
            "Diesel: four-cylinder engine with variable turbine geometry",
            "Under the hood of the CLE 220 d Coupé is the four-cylinder OM 654 M diesel engine. It is powered by a single-stage exhaust gas turbocharger with variable turbine geometry and friction-optimised roller bearing. The turbocharger is tuned so that the engine responds quickly and develops its power harmoniously. The electrification also includes the use of an electric refrigerant compressor for the air conditioning system. Exhaust aftertreatment includes a close-coupled NOx storage catalytic converter, a diesel particulate filter with a special coating (DPF), an SCR catalytic converter and an additional SCR catalytic converter in the vehicle's underbody.",
            "Transmission: Advanced nine-speed automatic",
            "The 9G-TRONIC transmission was further developed for the adaptation of the ISG and is used in all CLE models. The electric motor, the power electronics and the transmission cooler have been moved into or onto the transmission. The lines that were previously required are no longer required, which offers advantages in terms of installation space and weight. In addition, the efficiency of the transmission has been increased. Among other things, the optimised interaction with the electric auxiliary oil pump has made it possible to reduce the delivery volume of the mechanical pump by 30 percent compared to its predecessor - good for efficiency. In addition, a new generation of fully integrated transmission control with a multi-core processor and new assembly and connection technology is used. In addition to the increased computing power, the number of electrical interfaces has been drastically reduced and the weight of the transmission control has been reduced by 30 percent compared to its predecessor.",
            "The 4MATIC all-wheel drive has also been further developed. With the front-axle drive, higher torques can be transmitted and axle load distributions that are ideal in terms of driving dynamics can be achieved. In addition, there is a significant weight advantage compared to the corresponding component of the previous series. Less weight contributes to CO2 reduction.",
            "The suspension",
            "The suspension of the new Mercedes-Benz CLE Coupé enables agile driving fun on winding roads. At the same time, it offers exceptional driving comfort over long distances. The precise guidance of the front wheels on four links each plays a large part in the dynamic handling. On the rear axle, a multi-link construction with a five-link concept ensures good wheel control qualities and straight-line stability. There are three chassis variants to choose from. Compared to the sedan series, they are lowered by 15 millimetres as standard - for a more dynamic appearance.",
            "The standard equipment is the comfort suspension with lowering. It combines supreme driving comfort and sporty directness. Rolling behaviour, damping effect and stabilisation are continuously and automatically adapted to the surface. A sports suspension with an amplitude-selective damping system is available as an option. It offers a stiffer suspension and damping design as well as sports direct steering for more direct handling and agility. When cornering quickly or when making quick evasive manoeuvres, this sporty chassis tuning is noticeable in the form of less body roll.",
            "DYNAMIC BODY CONTROL with continuously adjustable damping individually for each wheel",
            "The technology package is available as an option for the CLE Coupé. It includes the DYNAMIC BODY CONTROL suspension with continuously adjustable damping on the front and rear axles as well as rear-axle steering. The active chassis controls the damping characteristics in conjunction with the engine, transmission and steering properties for each wheel individually - to suit the driving situation, speed and road surface conditions. The driver can use the DYNAMIC SELECT switch to choose between a comfortable or a sporty, taut setting. In conjunction with DYNAMIC BODY CONTROL, the CLE Coupé is equipped with sports direct steering. It combines a variable ratio that depends on the steering angle for precisely agile reactions with speed-dependent electromechanical power assistance for pleasantly smooth handling.",
            "Rear axle steering for even more agility",
            "With rear-axle steering and the associated more direct steering ratio on the front axle, the Mercedes-Benz CLE Coupé is particularly agile and stable at the same time. The steering angle on the rear axle is up to 2.5 degrees. This reduces the turning circle by 50 centimetres. In the models with 4MATIC it is 11.2 instead of 11.7 metres. In the rear-wheel drive versions, the turning circle is reduced from 11.2 to 10.7 metres. Despite its larger dimensions, the CLE Coupé with rear-wheel drive has a smaller turning circle than the C-Class Coupé (11.2 metres). In addition, thanks to the more direct steering ratio, the driver needs fewer turns of the steering wheel to turn it fully.",
            "At speeds below 60 km/h, the rear wheels steer in the opposite direction to the front wheels. The wheelbase is thus virtually shortened depending on the situation, making the vehicle more manoeuvrable, light-footed and agile. From a speed of 60 km/h, the rear wheels steer in the same direction as the front wheels. The resulting virtual longer wheelbase offers noticeable advantages: increased driving stability and driving safety at high speeds, fast lane changes or sudden evasive manoeuvres. In addition, significantly fewer steering angles have to be applied during dynamic manoeuvres. The CLE Coupé reacts more sportily to steering commands. This is supported by the integrated driving dynamics control of the ESP®.",
            "The driver assistance systems",
            "The standard equipment of the CLE Coupé includes ATTENTION ASSIST, Active Brake Assist, Active Lane Keeping Assist, Speed Limit Assist and the parking package with reversing camera. In Western Europe, Active Distance Assist DISTRONIC is also standard equipment. It aids the driver by adapting the speed to slower vehicles ahead. The desired target distance can be set in several stages. The status and activity of all driving assistance systems are shown full screen in the assistance display of the driver's display.",
            "Other driver assistance systems are part of equipment packages. The Advanced Plus package also includes Blind Spot Assist and Traffic Sign Assist. The premium package includes the parking package with 360-degree camera and DIGITAL LIGHT.",
            "The Driving Assistance Package Plus with extended functionality",
            "The Driving Assistance Package Plus is available as special equipment. It includes more than ten latest-generation assistance and safety systems.",
            "The parking systems: Faster into the space",
            "The Active Parking Assist PARKTRONIC has been improved in several respects: The starting process can now be performed intuitively via the central display. In addition, it is much faster to automatically park in and drive out than before. At the same time, the warning tones are omitted during the parking process. Active Parking Assist is part of the optional Parking Package with 360-degree Camera.",
            "The Memory Park Assistant (SAE Level 2) is also available for the Mercedes-Benz CLE Coupé. It can remember parking processes such as the arrival to and departure from the garage at home. The driver sits at the wheel and performs the parking process once. If the vehicle approaches the learned starting position, the parking process can be conveniently started via the central display. The driver monitors the parking process. If obstacles are registered, the vehicle stops until they are removed. The Memory Park Assistant can remember individual parking processes at up to five different locations. You can learn how to park in and drive out of a parking space at any location, up to a maximum of 100 metres in each case. Memory Park Assist is available in conjunction with the Driver Assistance Package Plus or the Parking Package with 360 Camera."

        "segments": [
            "Volkswagen presented the first facts and pictures of the new T-Cross: The car comes to customers with its revamped design, enhanced standard equipment, new technology features and a newly designed high-quality interior. Pre-sales are scheduled to start in the fourth quarter of 2023. In just four years, the T-Cross has captured a top position among compact SUVs: around 1.2 million people have already chosen this versatile Volkswagen. With an average of 300,000 units produced every year, the T-Cross, which is also offered outside Europe under the names Tacqua and Taigun, is currently one of the most successful Volkswagen models worldwide.",
            "Modern exterior design and fresh new colours",
            "From the outside, the updated Volkswagen T-Cross is immediately recognisable by the new design of its front and rear with new integrated LED headlights, LED daytime running lights and LED taillight clusters. The IQ.LIGHT LED matrix headlights are a completely new Volkswagen development and are offered for the first time on the T-Cross. Three new, fresh colours have been added to the model range: the solid colour Grape Yellow (a crisp, sporty yellow), Clear Blue Metallic (an elegant and friendly light blue) and Kings Red Metallic (a vivid, striking red).",
            "New infotainment system generation and high-quality interior",
            "The central element in the interior of the new Volkswagen T-Cross is the free-standing infotainment display. The standard touchscreen measures 20.3 cm (eight inches) across the diagonal; the top-of-the-range version has a 9.2-inch display with a diagonal of 23.4 cm. In addition, all versions of the four-door five-seater will now be fitted with digital instruments as standard. The dash panel in the T-Cross has also undergone a complete redesign: as in larger VW models, the dash panel features soft-upholstered and significantly higher-quality surface materials. The same applies to the front door trims of the Style and R-Line versions. A manual air conditioning system is on board as standard, and the Air Care Climatronic automatic air conditioner with back-lit touch sliders is available as an option.",
            "Well thought-out and variable, transport of e-bikes is now possible",
            "The T-Cross has always had one of the most spacious and versatile interiors of all compact SUVs. It impresses with its proven operating concept, well-arranged space for up to five people, a rear bench seat that can be moved by 140 mm and an extremely flexible luggage compartment. When all the seats are occupied, the T-Cross offers a luggage compartment capacity of between 385 and up to 455 litres when loaded up to the height of the rear bench seat. When the rear bench seat is folded down (60:40 split), this creates a flat load area with a stowage volume of up to 1,281 litres (loaded up to the height of the front seat backrests). The front passenger seat can additionally be folded down as standard from the Life specification package and up. The continuous load area from the rear to the front is then 2,398 mm long and can stow everything from surfboards to paragliders.",
            "Volkswagen has also increased the drawbar load of the T-Cross by a considerable margin: from 55 to 75 kg. This additional 20 kg increases the maximum load that can act vertically on the removable towbar (optional). The new T-Cross therefore offers greater scope towing a heavy trailer. At the same time, the maximum permitted weight of bicycles that can be transported on a carrier mounted on the towbar is increased - something that is particularly important for transporting e-bikes.",
            "Travel Assist offers significantly improved comfort",
            "The new Volkswagen T-Cross is one of the only vehicles in its class in the world to be optionally equipped with Travel Assist for greater longitudinal and lateral vehicle control. Depending on the traffic ahead and the permitted speed, the T-Cross can control the vehicle's speed with automatic acceleration and braking. Within the system limits, Travel Assist can also include speed limits, bends, and roundabouts in its control interventions. At the same time, Lane Assist can help to keep the vehicle in its lane. The new T-Cross can automatically perform stop-and-go operations when fitted with the DSG.",
            "LED headlights, LED taillights and \"Digital Cockpit\" as standard",
            "The significantly upgraded basic version of the VW T-Cross will now include features such as the new LED headlights (instead of halogen), new LED taillight clusters, a multifunction camera, Dynamic Road Sign Display, the Digital Cockpit, and a new, free-standing infotainment display for all versions. The next step up is the Life version, which includes, for example, new 16-inch alloy wheels and a leather multifunction steering wheel. The top versions are the Style (for more elegance) and R-Line (with sporty accents) specification packages. The new T-Cross models are powered by the well-known, efficient TSI engines from Volkswagen.",
            "Availability of the new T-Cross",
            "Pre-sales and activation of the online configurator for compact SUV will start in the fourth quarter of 2023. The market launch for dealers will begin in the first quarter of 2024. Despite the extensive enhancements, the new VW T-Cross will still be offered at a very attractive base price.",
            "The production of the bestseller in its current version is already sold out in many European markets for 2023 and will be available in Germany for a short time. New vehicles that Volkswagen customers configure and order after the final sales based on the current model will already be part of the new T-Cross generation when they are delivered in the first quarter of 2024."

            "Fuel economy is enhanced thanks to the new Predictive Efficient Drive system which learning a driver's regular routes and driving style, and automatically optimises the use of full-electric mode to minimise consumption. Additionally, navigation system data identifies regular locations for sudden deceleration, where regenerative braking is automatically increased to maximise energy recovery. When highways or uphill sections are approaching, which require additional power, the system proactively selects Hybrid mode to charge the battery for the upcoming high demand, further enhancing practical fuel efficiency. The system becomes increasingly effective as the amount of data available increases with the number of kilometres driven, enabling ever more efficient use of electrified power.",
            "That electrified power can again be generated cleanly by optional solar cells on the roof, which charge the new Prius when it is parked outdoors in sunlight. Power output is increased to 185 W, from 179 W, and the cells are now capable of generating power for up to 8.7 km (based on annual sunshine in Nagoya, Japan) of EV driving, without infrastructure or electricity costs. The battery can therefore be fully charged if the car remains parked for just over a week.",
            "The solar cells now charge the main battery directly, without the need for an additional solar battery as on the previous generation. Thanks to more efficient cells, the power generated by the Solar Charging roof is 15% higher than before, despite a smaller roof.",
            "The new Prius also features a multimedia package including access to a cloud-based navigation system, which uses constantly updated real-time traffic event information for accurate and efficient route planning.

This will respond to spoken requests from the driver or front seat passenger to adjust the climate control, choose multimedia options, make a phone call, or open and close the windows. \"Hey Toyota\" is designed to understand conversational speech, so the command \"I'm hungry\" will generate restaurant recommendations in the area, for example.",
            "In addition to the pre-set Normal, Eco and Sport modes familiar on most Hybrid and Plug-in Hybrid vehicles, the driving experience on the new Prius can be customised via the Drive Mode Select option on the centre console. Depending a driver's preference, a customised combination of powertrain, steering and air conditioning settings can be saved for instant access at any time.",
            "Driver Assist and Safety",
            "The Prius comes with the latest generation of Toyota's T-Mate system and Toyota Safety Sense, which includes new driver assist and accident prevention features whilst expanding existing capabilities to enhance safety, convenience and peace of mind.",
            "The semi-autonomous Advanced Park System allows easier and safer parking, and can conveniently memorise regularly used spots, such as at home or the workplace. Using its four Panoramic View Monitor cameras and 12 ultrasonic sensors, the Prius can manoeuvre, hands-free, into a space, with the driver only required to check surroundings and shift when prompted. In certain conditions, remote control operation is also possible, allowing the driver to step out of the car and initiate parking using a smartphone.",
            "Other T-Mate functions enhance a driver's awareness via features such as the Panoramic View Monitor which provides an all-round view of the vehicle's immediate surroundings during low-speed manoeuvres; Blind Spot Monitor and Rear Cross Traffic Alert with Automatic Braking, which warns of traffic and hazards when overtaking or reversing.",
            "Thanks to the new driver monitor camera, the status of the driver is constantly monitored for any sign of distraction, excessive fatigue or medical emergency. An audible alert will initially sound to prompt the driver and, when Lane Tracing Assist is activated, an Emergency Stop Driving System can safely bring the vehicle to a halt if the driver does not respond by steering, accelerating or decelerating within a pre-defined time. The effectiveness of the pre-collision system is also enhanced by considering a driver's status when a potential hazard is detected and adjusting its reaction accordingly.",
            "An expanded Road Sign Assist (RSA) function further supports safe driving by recognizing signs on the road ahead and displaying these on the instrument panel. In compliance with the latest European Union regulations, a driver is notified, visually on the display and by an audible alert, if they exceed the stated speed limit or overlook a 'no entry' sign. The Adaptive Cruiser Control (ACC) speed can be reset with the push of a button to respond to changes in the speed limit indicated by the RSA, while a speed limiter option can additionally be selected to prevent acceleration beyond a driver-defined speed.",
            "The ACC system has been updated and now also features a fourth setting for the following distance, compared to from the previous three. Enhanced vehicle detection allows the identification of more than one preceding vehicle, as well as those in adjacent lanes, helping the system to support highway overtaking by adjusting speeds in line with traffic conditions, especially when changing lanes. It also includes a new function to prevent inadvertent undertaking.",
            "An enhanced front camera sensor array now has double the forward detection distance and a wider lateral and vertical view, allowing it to detect objects earlier, as well as identifying a wider range of potential hazards, including motorcycles and roadside objects.",
            "By upgrading the performance of millimetre-wave radars at the front, an expanded detection range can now monitor objects closer to the front of the vehicle than previously. The new sensors have improved the detection capabilities of the Pre-Collision System, adding the capability to detect a motorcycle in addition to pedestrians and cyclists.",
            "Lane Departure Alert with Steering Assist now has enhanced lane recognition including detection of objects, such as walls or barriers, to help the system define a lane. Lane recognition is also enhanced for the Lane Tracing Assist system which now helps ensure more space between vehicles being overtaken in adjacent lanes by offsetting the vehicles' driving path with minor steering adjustments while keeping the vehicle within its lane.",
            "Proactive Driving Assist is another new Toyota Safety System feature. It supports drivers with gentle braking into corners or braking and/or steering to maintain a safe distance between a vehicle ahead, pedestrian or cyclist, using the vehicle's camera and radar.",
            "The new Toyota Prius is also equipped as standard with a front centre airbag that helps prevent contact between front occupants during a collision."

The shakedown at the Parma circuit is the precursor to a series of events marking the run-up to the official unveiling of the car at the end of June 2023 in Belgium, at the 24 Hours of Spa.",
            "Maserati is ready to reawaken the memories that saw it feature in the exciting GT championships, with a hungry new car designed to evoke the exploits of its forerunner, the glorious and victorious MC12.The Trident's history in motorsport is a story of successes spanning almost a century, of a unique and distinctive DNA, and of a passion being rekindled by the brand's link with the potent legacy from the past and its drive towards the future, in which racing is an essential component.",
            "Maserati GT2 is speed, elegance, style, and innovation incarnate. A car designed to be a masterpiece of performance: extraordinary and breathtaking between the kerbs, created to celebrate Maserati's return to the circuits. A new chapter begun in late 2022 with the announcement of its participation in the 2023 ABB FIA Formula E World Championship, complemented by its inclusion in the GT2 European Series, as part of the strategy developed to bring the Trident back on track.",
            "Conceived and designed by Maserati engineering in tandem with the Centro Stile Maserati, to ensure the aesthetic quality standards typical of the brand, the Maserati GT2 inherits the extraordinary 463kW/630CV Nettuno V6 engine from the Maserati MC20, taking it to a higher level.",
            "The most appealing technical specifications include the all-new patented MTC (Maserati Twin Combustion) technology based on F1 engines, the ultra-light carbon fiber central monocoque - an excellent solution to have a good weight-power ratio - and the lightweight full composite bodywork, where the aerodynamic features are exploited to the limit to improve the vertical load but at the same time ensuring the best efficiency in terms of drag. Much attention has been given to the development of the correct balance of the aerodynamic load, whereas the bottom has been developed specifically to work best in synergy with the front splitter and rear wing (adjustable); it has quick-release removable bodywork for optimized component replacement; the chassis features high torsional and bending stiffness.",
            "The power steering is full-electric. All suspension components of the car are specific racing components - there will be adjustable shock absorbers and adjustable anti roll bars in both the front and rear. Likewise, the electronics. The 6-speed sequential racing gearbox and steering wheel paddle shift with electrical rotary gearshift actuator evoke adrenaline-fueled emotions.",

            "A gem of mechanics and engineering, the spearhead of innovative technical solutions, with futuristic, minimalist, and sculptural interiors referring to the extreme lines of the body, the Maserati GT2 is dedicated to the racing teams and gentleman drivers due to take part in the GT2 Championships.",
            "The Trident single-seater with covered wheels is the result of a winning synergy between Maserati men and women and the avant-garde design and style that has always distinguished the creations of the Italian brand, complemented by its unmistakable flair of luxury, even when the road becomes a track. The fierce GT2 is therefore getting ready to explore new horizons, to consolidate and define Maserati's racing future in the world of motorsport.",
            "Andrea Bertolini, Maserati test driver, commented: \"The first few days are always quite unique, even more so for me when I was fortunate enough to bring Maserati to success at the GT1 World Championships, where I won four titles. We are now about to get back on track with yet another wonderful car. We've done lots of trial runs and early feedback is positive. Getting back behind the wheel of a GT was really exciting, and I could see everyone involved was very enthusiastic and motivated. We've focused on developing a product that not only stands up to its competitors but is also an ideal car for our gentleman drivers in terms of handling, comfort, and performance. We want them to experience a unique feeling in this car. In the last few months, we've been working intensively in the simulator, courtesy of the commitment of a fantastic team. I'd like to thank them, and the most positive aspect is that to follow these first few days, we're making it all a reality is to the very greatest extent.

            "Based on the SF90 Stradale, the new special limited series SF90 XX Stradale was unveiled alongside its SF90 XX Spider counterpart. To be built in just 799 and 599 examples respectively, these new V8-powered PHEVs represent the latest and most extreme example of a concept of special versions, which pushes the performance of Ferrari's road-going models to new levels.",
            "The concept has been honed over the past 20 years or so, with many of these models quickly becoming considered benchmarks in the Prancing Horse's line up, such as the 488 Pista and 812 Competizione. Over the same two decades, Ferrari has also developed the XX Programme to offer a select group of expert client drivers extreme cars that are not homologated for the road, but that can be driven at the very limit on the track. All of the models produced by the programme have proved a huge success, with the most recent addition being the FXX-K EVO.",
            "Drawing on its experience in both of these spheres, Ferrari decided to create a road-legal car which embodies the maximum expression of the two programmes' engineering concepts. The SF90 XX Stradale is based on the supercar in the range, the SF90 Stradale, and raises its already impressively exhilarating track and on-the-limit driving experience to new heights. Performance is boosted thanks to its impressive 1,030 cv (30 more than the SF90 Stradale), specific software logics and the use of radical new aerodynamics solutions, including a fixed rear spoiler - the first to appear on a road-going Ferrari since the days of the F50 - which delivers an unparalleled 530 kg of downforce at 250 km/h.",
            "The same concept provided the inspiration for the Ferrari SF90 XX Spider, which combines the ultimate on-track adrenaline rush with the heady pleasure of en plein air driving, where the iconic sound of the Ferrari V8 gives such a vital contribution. The SF90 XX Spider benefits from the same sophisticated aero solutions as the SF90 XX Stradale, as well as specifically developed cockpit air flows that guarantee superb occupant comfort with the top down. It is equipped with Ferrari's acclaimed Retractable Hard Top (RHT), which comprises aluminium panels and not only deploys and retracts in a mere 14 seconds, but can also be activated at speeds of up to 45 km/h.",
            "POWERTRAIN",
            "The SF90 XX Stradale has also inherited the signature PHEV layout found in the SF90 Stradale and SF90 Spider, in which the V8 internal combustion engine is integrated with three electric motors, two independent on the front axle, and one located between the engine and gearbox at the rear. This configuration allows the car to unleash a maximum of 1030 cv (+30 cv more than the SF90 Stradale), setting a whole new performance benchmark.",
            "INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE",
            "Thanks to its 797 cv, the mid-rear-mounted V8 turbo raises the performance limit bar still further for this particular architecture. The SF90 Stradale's power unit was used as the starting point for the F154FB engine which powers the Ferrari SF90 XX Stradale, and is now significantly more extreme. Efficiency was increased by polishing the inlet and exhaust ducts and the compression ratio was increased with the adoption of new pistons and specific machining of the combustion chamber. The removal of the secondary air system also slashed 3.5 kg off the engine's weight compared to the previous application.",
            "ENGINE SOUND",
            "The SF90 XX Stradale's soundtrack was redesigned to become the ultimate encapsulation of the car's racing soul. To produce an even fuller, richer sound and celebrate the harmonics right across the V8's rev range, the hot tube system was optimised. This transmits the combustion pulsations into the cabin, highlighting the higher frequencies to reveal the ultimate evolution of the Ferrari V8.",
            "The use of innovative materials improved the acoustic clarity of the system: the result is a wonderfully rich explosion of iconic Ferrari V8 sound. The tube from the intake plenum has been redesigned and repositioned closer to the cabin's bulkhead so that occupants are treated to even edgier, more raucous harmonics as the engine takes in greater quantities of air to deliver the desired torque. The resonator is now nearer the engine to create a richer harmony and increase intensity.",
            "Work carried out on both branches of the hot tube system has produced a clear improvement in sound quality, which is at its finest at mid revs. However, as the car edges nearer to the limiter, the point at which the car unleashes the pinnacle of its power and might, the modifications ensure both quality and intensity continue to increase smoothly and progressively.",
            "ELECTRIC MOTORS",
            "Like the SF90 Stradale, the SF90 XX Stradale has three electric motors, one located between the ICE and the gearbox and two on the front axle. In this instance, they deliver a maximum of 233 cv or 171 kW, thanks to the patented extra boost vehicle dynamics logic, an absolute first on a Prancing Horse road car. The Ferrari SF90 XX Stradale's high performance lithium-ion battery powers the three motors, guaranteeing a 25km range in full-electric mode. When the ICE is off, the front motors give the car a maximum speed of 135 km/h.",
            "The control logic optimally manages the power flows focussing on either efficiency or performance as required. The driver can use the eManettino selector on the steering wheel to choose from four different power management modes. In eDrive mode, the internal combustion engine is turned off and traction is entrusted entirely to the front axle; in Hybrid mode, it favours battery energy depletion and manages transitions autonomously, maximising the full-electric range; in Performance mode, the internal combustion engine is kept running as the priority is on maintaining consistent performance, rather than on achieving the peak power; and in Qualifying, the system unleashes its maximum power output, thanks to a control logic that prioritises performance, using the brand-new extra boost function.",
            "GEARBOX",
            "The SF90 XX Stradale and the SF90 XX Spider retain the 8-speed dual-clutch gearbox that made its first appearance in the Ferrari range on the SF90 Stradale. However, the gear-shift logic has changed significantly: the car uses the patented logic introduced on the Ferrari Daytona SP3 to reach more engaging dynamic acceleration profiles. Furthermore, the new logic improves the gear-shift sound by introducing an exhaust note similar to the overrun on lift-off noise typical of high-performance driving at medium/high revs.",
            "To that end, the Ferrari engineers developed a specific engine calibration that works in synergy with the gearbox control logic: the SF90 Stradale's actuation sequence was redesigned and the combustion chamber pressure cycle was optimised to maximise the intensity of the gear-shift sound, at exactly the point of lift-off to allow the gearbox to engage.",
            "AERODYNAMICS",
            "The Ferrari SF90 XX Stradale delivers the most efficient aerodynamic performance of any road-going car in Ferrari's history, making it comparable only to that of the LaFerrari supercar. It delivers double the maximum downforce of the SF90 Stradale, improving grip and yielding a palpably faster lap time at Fiorano. The product of Maranello's inestimable racing experience, this result was reached by redesigning the cooling flow management for the thermal and electric components as well the engine compartment to cope with the higher maximum power available.",
            "From an aerodynamics perspective, the signature element is most definitely the rear fixed wing which was developed from experience with the XX Programme cars. This is an element with enormous aero potential that proved a natural fit for this particular application, thanks to close collaboration with the Ferrari Styling Centre. Its shape was dictated by the need to efficiently hone the way in which the pressure field created by the wing interacts with the complex pressure and backpressure systems that develop around the shut-off Gurney.",
            "The latter, which was also redesigned, efficiently manages the downforce/drag trade-off and has two configurations: LD (Low Drag) in which the mobile element is raised and is faired in with the fixed section, minimising drag to enhance longitudinal performance, while in HD (High Downforce), the mobile element is lowered, closing the blown area, thereby allowing the air to hit the fixed area. This generates an overpressure area which, aside from generating rear downforce, also deflects the incoming flow vertically to help deliver the absolute maximum rear downforce possible: 315 kg at 250 km/h.",
            "The ICE benefits from improved cooling thanks to the fact that the front radiators for the high temperature cooling circuit are more efficient. The new layout of the underbody was also optimised to guarantee improved extraction of the air coming off the radiators ahead of the front wheels. The side louvres on the lower part of the front bumper, already seen on the SF90 Stradale, were also redesigned and are now larger to reduce backpressure.",
            "The simultaneous increase in power and downforce posed a new challenge which Ferrari's engineers tackled by reversing the layout of the medium temperature radiator, tasked with cooling the electrical components, increasing its efficiency and also enclosing a part of the car's underbody, thereby increasing the effective surfaces that would help generate front downforce. It should come as no surprise that this very clearly race-derived architecture is shared by the brand-new 296 GT3.",
            "The different inclination of the front radiator improved the aerodynamic coefficients, simultaneously channelling hot air flows through and over the front bonnet. These flows are controlled and channelled over the car by two S-Ducts located one on either side of the vents in the centre of the bonnet.",
            "At the rear of the car, a scoop in front of the entry to the intercooler air intake cleans and slows the expansion of the flow arriving at the radiators. When the car is moving, cool air is drawn into the engine compartment through three apertures: the first located above the intercooler intake on the side and the second crossways on the engine cover, while the third is a pair of ducts located to the sides of the struts of the fixed spoiler.",
            "The car also has a specific front splitter, which is larger than the SF90 Stradale's, and is the result of meticulous work in the wind tunnel. It generates a highly energised tube of air flow under the car and this is then exploited by the redesigned underbody. A larger, wider front diffuser contributes to the increase in downforce of over 45 kg at 250 km/h, by working in synergy with vortex generators that themselves have been redesigned. The downforce generated by the underbody is stabilised and multiplied by specifically shaped bodywork surfaces.",
            "As already mentioned, the two S-Ducts alone help increase front downforce by 20% compared to the SF90 Stradale. The introduction of the louvres on the front wheelarch was fundamental to this, however, as they allow dynamic extraction from the front wheel housing, thus giving the car an overall front downforce figure of 325 kg at top speed.",
            "The increase in drag was managed by working on the forms with the greatest potential impact on the body's Cd: two different blown ducts have been incorporated into the front bumper to reduce overpressure and increase the permeability of the bodywork. The first, located at front radiator height, creates a small bubble that shields and fairs in the front wheel in more efficiently. The second channels the energised air directly onto the front bonnet, thereby encouraging the air to flow over it and the flanks, and keeping the flow tube entering the radiators at the sides clean.",
            "The evacuation of the rear part of the wheel housing has a beneficial effect on both downforce generation and drag, and the surfaces created allow the correct management of the air flow exiting the wheel.",
            "The rear diffuser was further developed to guarantee it makes a pivotal contribution by generating highly efficient downforce, thanks to carefully designing the trailing edge around the expansion volume, which helps keep the car's wake compact.",
            "VEHICLE DYNAMICS",
            "The focus with the Ferrari SF90 XX Stradale's development was to produce the most high-performance Ferrari road car ever that also delivered maximum fun behind the wheel, whilst fully retaining all of the functionalities of the SF90 Stradale's hybrid powertrain. Usability of performance was especially important, particularly in terms of the electric mode's ability to deliver surprisingly high performance driving both in typically urban settings and in out-of-town trips - in fact, the top speed in eDrive mode is 135 km/h.",
            "The transition from electric mode to hybrid mode is extremely smooth thanks to the seamless coordination between the electric front axle, the 8-speed DCT gearbox, the rear-mounted electric motor and the V8 engine. This in turn guarantees progressive, continuous acceleration and makes all the powertrain's power available as rapidly as possible.",
            "The Torque Vectoring and Energy Recovery under braking and lift-off functions are available in all configurations, and the Ferrari Dynamic Enhancer (2.0) makes its debut. It is also active in all dynamic Manettino positions and all grip conditions. The various systems are all managed by the electronic Side Slip Control (eSSC) 1.0.",
            "Another major new addition is the ABS EVO controller, which debuted on the 296 GTB. Thanks to its integration with the 6W-CDS sensor it improves both performance and repeatability in high performance braking in dry conditions. It functions in high grip situations and in the Manettino positions from Race upwards using the data from the 6W-CDS sensor to obtain a precise estimation of the car's speed. This makes it possible to determine the target slip of all four wheels and consequently optimise brake distribution.",
            "Consequently, the longitudinal force of the four tyres can be better exploited both in braking in a straight line and under braking during turn-in, where the rear axle has to deliver a natural trade-off between longitudinal braking performance and lateral stability. The system maximises the repeatability of the braking manoeuvre to a target value, reducing losses due to the tolerances of the components or the natural variability of test conditions. The controller thus allows the SF90 XX Stradale to brake later and in a more repeatable manner, thus enhancing its handling on the track.",
            "The 6W-CDS sensor delivers much more data than the previous iteration: in particular, its ability to measure both the acceleration and the speed of rotation on three axes (X, Y, Z) enables the other vehicle dynamic controls to more accurately read the car's dynamic behaviour, thus optimising their intervention with much greater precision.",
            "In addition to this, also debuting on Ferrari SF90 XX Stradale is the extra boost control logic which guarantees additional power in short bursts. The job of this software, which is only active in the Qualifying mode of the eManettino, is to produce an extra boost of power at the critical moment when the car is exiting a bend, something which alone improves lap time by 0.25s at Fiorano. The logic controls the power delivery, managing peak performance with battery charge, also monitoring the status of the components with the aim of optimising electric power delivery.",
            "The availability of the extra boost is indicated by a graph on the right-hand side of the dash display, and shows the remaining number of bursts left (maximum 30). The control logic guarantees this feature is fully useable for at least one or more laps of the track depending on the latter's individual characteristics. This is thanks to the fact that the areas of the track where activating the power surplus is most useful are pinpointed heuristically, attempting to exclude areas where using it would not reduce the lap time.",
            "The car has a set-up with elastic characteristics and kinematic angles designed solely to optimise its behaviour on the limit. There is a 9% improvement in lateral performance (Ay max) compared to the SF90 Stradale in high speed handling conditions, mostly as a result of downforce. Furthermore, the roll rate was reduced by 10% thereby guaranteeing better body control.",
            "Because the new car delivers significantly more downforce than the SF90 Stradale and consequently more rapid deceleration, the SF90 XX Stradale's braking system was also upgraded. While it retains the Aero callipers at the front, the front discs have been completely redesigned to improve cooling, there are now bigger 390mm-diameter rear discs and the brake pads are a new design that maximise the contact surface to improve the coefficient of friction.",
            "EXTERIOR STYLING",
            "The SF90 XX Stradale is the most extreme version of the SF90 Stradale; its design criteria are thus those of a track car, calibrated to ensure it can be homologated for road use. That said, the Ferrari SF90 XX Stradale is not just a special version: it is the first XX model to go through the factory gates, transferring the very pinnacle of Prancing Horse track technology, aerodynamic efficiency and power, to the road.",
            "Designed by the Ferrari Styling Centre headed by Flavio Manzoni, the SF90 XX Stradale incorporates the engineering principles that underpinned the SF90 Stradale and pushes them to new extremes. Thanks to the close synergic relationship between the Styling Centre and the Technical Department, significant modifications were carried out, predominantly with the aim of increasing the downforce of the original car.",
            "In terms of its concept, this is to all intents and purposes an XX car. Its characteristics, the fruit of a more incisive, radical design language, are even more extreme still. The SF90 XX Stradale's styling cues are designed to highlight its thoroughbred performance characteristics whilst still retaining the pure lines and forms of its predecessor. Hence the decision not to hide air intakes and vents, a fundamental part of racing cars' stylistic language. A technical solution that also becomes a signature element: the three louvres on the SF90 XX Stradale's front wing and on the rear one are an example of this. As was the case with the F12tdf, these are typical cues from Ferrari's styling language.",
            "There is no doubt that one of the most distinctive characteristics of the Ferrari SF90 XX Stradale's design is its rear wing. The tail volume, which has been specifically redesigned with aero in mind, is now sleeker, giving it the long tail silhouette typical of racing cars. The air intakes for the intercoolers are now larger too, channelling the air towards the radiators more efficiently.",
            "The arrow-shape front wing concept has been retained on the SF90 XX Stradale. The headlights, which now have an even lower upper profile, are now integrated into this area by two external vertical wing profiles. This creates what we might call a more geometric language that reflects the spirit of this new car. New and distinctive elements of the front section are the two imposing lower wings that dominate the air intakes, which look as if they are floating, making the SF90 XX Stradale itself seem broader and more glued to the asphalt than any other.",
            "The rear of the car is characterised by the trimaran design of the tail. Compared to the SF90 Stradale, the SF90 XX Stradale features more imposing rear vents behind the wheels. The trimaran section also incorporates two central exhausts. Design-wise, the aim here was to visually underscore the impressive width of the rear of the car and this was achieved by drawing on a layering concept.",
            "One of the layers is the fixed rear wing, a solution not seen on a street legal Ferrari since the 1995 F50. The second is the body-coloured profile that wraps around a light-bar, an element that is a complete departure from the twin-taillight concept of the SF90 Stradale. The third layer, already seen on the SF90, is the blown spoiler combined with an active aero concept known as a shut-off Gurney.",
            "Carbon-fibre elements stand out from bodywork colour elements all over the car, but most especially in its lower section, to underscore the car's technical aspects. Other connotative elements are the air vents in the shape of rounded-off quadrangles on both the front bonnet and rear engine lid, which effectively become a part of the car's livery. They are designed as touches of colour that coordinate with the end plates on the carbon-fibre rear wing, for instance. The car also sports specific star-burst wheel rims with prominent aerodynamic profiles.",
            "INTERIOR",
            "The guiding principle of the Ferrari SF90 XX Stradale's interior design was highlighting the cockpit's racing vocation through solutions that would provide significant weight-savings. The main areas involved were the door panels, tunnel and mats, which are now simpler in terms of their shape and the mainly technical fabrics used, while carbon-fibre was used for functional areas. The upper part of the dashboard is trimmed in Alcantara®, while the lower part is trimmed in technical fabric. Both are inspired by the racing world.",
            "The door panels emphasise the theme seen aboard the SF90 Stradale: the concave sections that converge on the dashboard are highlighted by the colour contrast. The three louvres in the middle zone, on the other hand are a nod to the air vents on the wheel arch, creating an overall dynamic, sculptural effect. The three apertures, which reference the exterior language, also seamlessly integrate technical and control functions, in a completely new stylistic interpretation.",
            "The pared-back central tunnel not only looks, but is exceptionally light. It is dominated by the gear shift gate which is located now centrally and more forward on the tunnel compared to the SF90 Stradale. The window lifters and the key compartment are on a secondary level. The styling theme is characterised by volumes that create a sophisticated combination of functional voids and structural solids, lending the tunnel a sporty yet sophisticated appeal while still highlighting its functionality.",
            "A specific racing seat with a visible carbon-fibre tubular structure and cushion supports was designed for the car to enhance sporty driving pleasure without compromising on comfort. The backrest rake mechanism has been integrated into the seat using elastic trim materials which hide the separation between the backrest and seat squab. This means that the structure looks seamless at all times - just like a single-piece seat while also allowing the backrest to be adjusted. Together with the carbon-fibre structure, this feature saved 1.3 kg in weight compared to the SF90 Stradale's single-piece seat.",
            "SF90 XX Spider",
            "The SF90 XX Spider allowed the Ferrari Styling Centre to use the modifications made to the rear of the car to create an instantly recognisable architecture in which the flying buttress, a much-loved part of Ferrari tradition, seamlessly melds with the arrow theme of the front. The resulting visual effect extends the body forwards and lending it a completely different connotation to the SF90 XX Stradale.",
            "The car's centre of gravity thus appears to be lower too, particularly from the side. This is not just because of the roof, which has a wraparound windscreen that seamlessly melds with the side windows, but also because the flying buttresses are lower than on the SF90 XX Stradale. Although the roll-bars protrude from the rest of the bodywork when the roof is lowered, the fact that they are carbon-fibre means they don't sully the broad, squat look created by the flying buttresses. This in turn enhances the visual lowering of the car's volume.",
            "When the roof is up, the roll-bars seamlessly connect to and become one with the roof structure. Like the roll-bars, the top is carbon-fibre and thanks to the renowned Ferrari Retractable Hard Top (RHT) mechanism, can be opened while the car is moving in a mere 14 seconds at a speed of up to 45 km/h, allowing occupants to enjoy the car to the utmost in all kinds of weather.",
            "7 YEARS MAINTENANCE",
            "Ferrari's unparalleled quality standards and strong focus on client service underpin the extended seven-year maintenance programme offered with both the SF90 XX Stradale and the SF90 XX Spider.

            "Based on the SF90 Stradale, the new special limited series SF90 XX Stradale was unveiled alongside its SF90 XX Spider counterpart. To be built in just 799 and 599 examples respectively, these new V8-powered PHEVs represent the latest and most extreme example of a concept of special versions, which pushes the performance of Ferrari's road-going models to new levels.",
            "The concept has been honed over the past 20 years or so, with many of these models quickly becoming considered benchmarks in the Prancing Horse's line up, such as the 488 Pista and 812 Competizione. Over the same two decades, Ferrari has also developed the XX Programme to offer a select group of expert client drivers extreme cars that are not homologated for the road, but that can be driven at the very limit on the track. All of the models produced by the programme have proved a huge success, with the most recent addition being the FXX-K EVO.",
            "Drawing on its experience in both of these spheres, Ferrari decided to create a road-legal car which embodies the maximum expression of the two programmes' engineering concepts. The SF90 XX Stradale is based on the supercar in the range, the SF90 Stradale, and raises its already impressively exhilarating track and on-the-limit driving experience to new heights. Performance is boosted thanks to its impressive 1,030 cv (30 more than the SF90 Stradale), specific software logics and the use of radical new aerodynamics solutions, including a fixed rear spoiler - the first to appear on a road-going Ferrari since the days of the F50 - which delivers an unparalleled 530 kg of downforce at 250 km/h.",
            "The same concept provided the inspiration for the Ferrari SF90 XX Spider, which combines the ultimate on-track adrenaline rush with the heady pleasure of en plein air driving, where the iconic sound of the Ferrari V8 gives such a vital contribution. The SF90 XX Spider benefits from the same sophisticated aero solutions as the SF90 XX Stradale, as well as specifically developed cockpit air flows that guarantee superb occupant comfort with the top down. It is equipped with Ferrari's acclaimed Retractable Hard Top (RHT), which comprises aluminium panels and not only deploys and retracts in a mere 14 seconds, but can also be activated at speeds of up to 45 km/h.",
            "POWERTRAIN",
            "The SF90 XX Stradale has also inherited the signature PHEV layout found in the SF90 Stradale and SF90 Spider, in which the V8 internal combustion engine is integrated with three electric motors, two independent on the front axle, and one located between the engine and gearbox at the rear. This configuration allows the car to unleash a maximum of 1030 cv (+30 cv more than the SF90 Stradale), setting a whole new performance benchmark.",
            "INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE",
            "Thanks to its 797 cv, the mid-rear-mounted V8 turbo raises the performance limit bar still further for this particular architecture. The SF90 Stradale's power unit was used as the starting point for the F154FB engine which powers the Ferrari SF90 XX Stradale, and is now significantly more extreme. Efficiency was increased by polishing the inlet and exhaust ducts and the compression ratio was increased with the adoption of new pistons and specific machining of the combustion chamber. The removal of the secondary air system also slashed 3.5 kg off the engine's weight compared to the previous application.",
            "ENGINE SOUND",
            "The SF90 XX Stradale's soundtrack was redesigned to become the ultimate encapsulation of the car's racing soul. To produce an even fuller, richer sound and celebrate the harmonics right across the V8's rev range, the hot tube system was optimised. This transmits the combustion pulsations into the cabin, highlighting the higher frequencies to reveal the ultimate evolution of the Ferrari V8.",
            "The use of innovative materials improved the acoustic clarity of the system: the result is a wonderfully rich explosion of iconic Ferrari V8 sound. The tube from the intake plenum has been redesigned and repositioned closer to the cabin's bulkhead so that occupants are treated to even edgier, more raucous harmonics as the engine takes in greater quantities of air to deliver the desired torque. The resonator is now nearer the engine to create a richer harmony and increase intensity.",
            "Work carried out on both branches of the hot tube system has produced a clear improvement in sound quality, which is at its finest at mid revs. However, as the car edges nearer to the limiter, the point at which the car unleashes the pinnacle of its power and might, the modifications ensure both quality and intensity continue to increase smoothly and progressively.",
            "ELECTRIC MOTORS",
            "Like the SF90 Stradale, the SF90 XX Stradale has three electric motors, one located between the ICE and the gearbox and two on the front axle. In this instance, they deliver a maximum of 233 cv or 171 kW, thanks to the patented extra boost vehicle dynamics logic, an absolute first on a Prancing Horse road car. The Ferrari SF90 XX Stradale's high performance lithium-ion battery powers the three motors, guaranteeing a 25km range in full-electric mode. When the ICE is off, the front motors give the car a maximum speed of 135 km/h.",
            "The control logic optimally manages the power flows focussing on either efficiency or performance as required. The driver can use the eManettino selector on the steering wheel to choose from four different power management modes. In eDrive mode, the internal combustion engine is turned off and traction is entrusted entirely to the front axle; in Hybrid mode, it favours battery energy depletion and manages transitions autonomously, maximising the full-electric range; in Performance mode, the internal combustion engine is kept running as the priority is on maintaining consistent performance, rather than on achieving the peak power; and in Qualifying, the system unleashes its maximum power output, thanks to a control logic that prioritises performance, using the brand-new extra boost function.",
            "GEARBOX",
            "The SF90 XX Stradale and the SF90 XX Spider retain the 8-speed dual-clutch gearbox that made its first appearance in the Ferrari range on the SF90 Stradale. However, the gear-shift logic has changed significantly: the car uses the patented logic introduced on the Ferrari Daytona SP3 to reach more engaging dynamic acceleration profiles. Furthermore, the new logic improves the gear-shift sound by introducing an exhaust note similar to the overrun on lift-off noise typical of high-performance driving at medium/high revs.",
            "To that end, the Ferrari engineers developed a specific engine calibration that works in synergy with the gearbox control logic: the SF90 Stradale's actuation sequence was redesigned and the combustion chamber pressure cycle was optimised to maximise the intensity of the gear-shift sound, at exactly the point of lift-off to allow the gearbox to engage.",
            "AERODYNAMICS",
            "The Ferrari SF90 XX Stradale delivers the most efficient aerodynamic performance of any road-going car in Ferrari's history, making it comparable only to that of the LaFerrari supercar. It delivers double the maximum downforce of the SF90 Stradale, improving grip and yielding a palpably faster lap time at Fiorano. The product of Maranello's inestimable racing experience, this result was reached by redesigning the cooling flow management for the thermal and electric components as well the engine compartment to cope with the higher maximum power available.",
            "From an aerodynamics perspective, the signature element is most definitely the rear fixed wing which was developed from experience with the XX Programme cars. This is an element with enormous aero potential that proved a natural fit for this particular application, thanks to close collaboration with the Ferrari Styling Centre. Its shape was dictated by the need to efficiently hone the way in which the pressure field created by the wing interacts with the complex pressure and backpressure systems that develop around the shut-off Gurney.",
            "The latter, which was also redesigned, efficiently manages the downforce/drag trade-off and has two configurations: LD (Low Drag) in which the mobile element is raised and is faired in with the fixed section, minimising drag to enhance longitudinal performance, while in HD (High Downforce), the mobile element is lowered, closing the blown area, thereby allowing the air to hit the fixed area. This generates an overpressure area which, aside from generating rear downforce, also deflects the incoming flow vertically to help deliver the absolute maximum rear downforce possible: 315 kg at 250 km/h.",
            "The ICE benefits from improved cooling thanks to the fact that the front radiators for the high temperature cooling circuit are more efficient. The new layout of the underbody was also optimised to guarantee improved extraction of the air coming off the radiators ahead of the front wheels. The side louvres on the lower part of the front bumper, already seen on the SF90 Stradale, were also redesigned and are now larger to reduce backpressure.",
            "The simultaneous increase in power and downforce posed a new challenge which Ferrari's engineers tackled by reversing the layout of the medium temperature radiator, tasked with cooling the electrical components, increasing its efficiency and also enclosing a part of the car's underbody, thereby increasing the effective surfaces that would help generate front downforce. It should come as no surprise that this very clearly race-derived architecture is shared by the brand-new 296 GT3.",
            "The different inclination of the front radiator improved the aerodynamic coefficients, simultaneously channelling hot air flows through and over the front bonnet. These flows are controlled and channelled over the car by two S-Ducts located one on either side of the vents in the centre of the bonnet.",
            "At the rear of the car, a scoop in front of the entry to the intercooler air intake cleans and slows the expansion of the flow arriving at the radiators. When the car is moving, cool air is drawn into the engine compartment through three apertures: the first located above the intercooler intake on the side and the second crossways on the engine cover, while the third is a pair of ducts located to the sides of the struts of the fixed spoiler.",
            "The car also has a specific front splitter, which is larger than the SF90 Stradale's, and is the result of meticulous work in the wind tunnel. It generates a highly energised tube of air flow under the car and this is then exploited by the redesigned underbody. A larger, wider front diffuser contributes to the increase in downforce of over 45 kg at 250 km/h, by working in synergy with vortex generators that themselves have been redesigned. The downforce generated by the underbody is stabilised and multiplied by specifically shaped bodywork surfaces.",
            "As already mentioned, the two S-Ducts alone help increase front downforce by 20% compared to the SF90 Stradale. The introduction of the louvres on the front wheelarch was fundamental to this, however, as they allow dynamic extraction from the front wheel housing, thus giving the car an overall front downforce figure of 325 kg at top speed.",
            "The increase in drag was managed by working on the forms with the greatest potential impact on the body's Cd: two different blown ducts have been incorporated into the front bumper to reduce overpressure and increase the permeability of the bodywork. The first, located at front radiator height, creates a small bubble that shields and fairs in the front wheel in more efficiently. The second channels the energised air directly onto the front bonnet, thereby encouraging the air to flow over it and the flanks, and keeping the flow tube entering the radiators at the sides clean.",
            "The evacuation of the rear part of the wheel housing has a beneficial effect on both downforce generation and drag, and the surfaces created allow the correct management of the air flow exiting the wheel.",
            "The rear diffuser was further developed to guarantee it makes a pivotal contribution by generating highly efficient downforce, thanks to carefully designing the trailing edge around the expansion volume, which helps keep the car's wake compact.",
            "VEHICLE DYNAMICS",
            "The focus with the Ferrari SF90 XX Stradale's development was to produce the most high-performance Ferrari road car ever that also delivered maximum fun behind the wheel, whilst fully retaining all of the functionalities of the SF90 Stradale's hybrid powertrain. Usability of performance was especially important, particularly in terms of the electric mode's ability to deliver surprisingly high performance driving both in typically urban settings and in out-of-town trips - in fact, the top speed in eDrive mode is 135 km/h.",
            "The transition from electric mode to hybrid mode is extremely smooth thanks to the seamless coordination between the electric front axle, the 8-speed DCT gearbox, the rear-mounted electric motor and the V8 engine. This in turn guarantees progressive, continuous acceleration and makes all the powertrain's power available as rapidly as possible.",
            "The Torque Vectoring and Energy Recovery under braking and lift-off functions are available in all configurations, and the Ferrari Dynamic Enhancer (2.0) makes its debut. It is also active in all dynamic Manettino positions and all grip conditions. The various systems are all managed by the electronic Side Slip Control (eSSC) 1.0.",
            "Another major new addition is the ABS EVO controller, which debuted on the 296 GTB. Thanks to its integration with the 6W-CDS sensor it improves both performance and repeatability in high performance braking in dry conditions. It functions in high grip situations and in the Manettino positions from Race upwards using the data from the 6W-CDS sensor to obtain a precise estimation of the car's speed. This makes it possible to determine the target slip of all four wheels and consequently optimise brake distribution.",
            "Consequently, the longitudinal force of the four tyres can be better exploited both in braking in a straight line and under braking during turn-in, where the rear axle has to deliver a natural trade-off between longitudinal braking performance and lateral stability. The system maximises the repeatability of the braking manoeuvre to a target value, reducing losses due to the tolerances of the components or the natural variability of test conditions. The controller thus allows the SF90 XX Stradale to brake later and in a more repeatable manner, thus enhancing its handling on the track.",
            "The 6W-CDS sensor delivers much more data than the previous iteration: in particular, its ability to measure both the acceleration and the speed of rotation on three axes (X, Y, Z) enables the other vehicle dynamic controls to more accurately read the car's dynamic behaviour, thus optimising their intervention with much greater precision.",
            "In addition to this, also debuting on Ferrari SF90 XX Stradale is the extra boost control logic which guarantees additional power in short bursts. The job of this software, which is only active in the Qualifying mode of the eManettino, is to produce an extra boost of power at the critical moment when the car is exiting a bend, something which alone improves lap time by 0.25s at Fiorano. The logic controls the power delivery, managing peak performance with battery charge, also monitoring the status of the components with the aim of optimising electric power delivery.",
            "The availability of the extra boost is indicated by a graph on the right-hand side of the dash display, and shows the remaining number of bursts left (maximum 30). The control logic guarantees this feature is fully useable for at least one or more laps of the track depending on the latter's individual characteristics. This is thanks to the fact that the areas of the track where activating the power surplus is most useful are pinpointed heuristically, attempting to exclude areas where using it would not reduce the lap time.",
            "The car has a set-up with elastic characteristics and kinematic angles designed solely to optimise its behaviour on the limit. There is a 9% improvement in lateral performance (Ay max) compared to the SF90 Stradale in high speed handling conditions, mostly as a result of downforce. Furthermore, the roll rate was reduced by 10% thereby guaranteeing better body control.",
            "Because the new car delivers significantly more downforce than the SF90 Stradale and consequently more rapid deceleration, the SF90 XX Stradale's braking system was also upgraded. While it retains the Aero callipers at the front, the front discs have been completely redesigned to improve cooling, there are now bigger 390mm-diameter rear discs and the brake pads are a new design that maximise the contact surface to improve the coefficient of friction.",
            "EXTERIOR STYLING",
            "The SF90 XX Stradale is the most extreme version of the SF90 Stradale; its design criteria are thus those of a track car, calibrated to ensure it can be homologated for road use. That said, the Ferrari SF90 XX Stradale is not just a special version: it is the first XX model to go through the factory gates, transferring the very pinnacle of Prancing Horse track technology, aerodynamic efficiency and power, to the road.",
            "Designed by the Ferrari Styling Centre headed by Flavio Manzoni, the SF90 XX Stradale incorporates the engineering principles that underpinned the SF90 Stradale and pushes them to new extremes. Thanks to the close synergic relationship between the Styling Centre and the Technical Department, significant modifications were carried out, predominantly with the aim of increasing the downforce of the original car.",
            "In terms of its concept, this is to all intents and purposes an XX car. Its characteristics, the fruit of a more incisive, radical design language, are even more extreme still. The SF90 XX Stradale's styling cues are designed to highlight its thoroughbred performance characteristics whilst still retaining the pure lines and forms of its predecessor. Hence the decision not to hide air intakes and vents, a fundamental part of racing cars' stylistic language. A technical solution that also becomes a signature element: the three louvres on the SF90 XX Stradale's front wing and on the rear one are an example of this. As was the case with the F12tdf, these are typical cues from Ferrari's styling language.",
            "There is no doubt that one of the most distinctive characteristics of the Ferrari SF90 XX Stradale's design is its rear wing. The tail volume, which has been specifically redesigned with aero in mind, is now sleeker, giving it the long tail silhouette typical of racing cars. The air intakes for the intercoolers are now larger too, channelling the air towards the radiators more efficiently.",
            "The arrow-shape front wing concept has been retained on the SF90 XX Stradale. The headlights, which now have an even lower upper profile, are now integrated into this area by two external vertical wing profiles. This creates what we might call a more geometric language that reflects the spirit of this new car. New and distinctive elements of the front section are the two imposing lower wings that dominate the air intakes, which look as if they are floating, making the SF90 XX Stradale itself seem broader and more glued to the asphalt than any other.",
            "The rear of the car is characterised by the trimaran design of the tail. Compared to the SF90 Stradale, the SF90 XX Stradale features more imposing rear vents behind the wheels. The trimaran section also incorporates two central exhausts. Design-wise, the aim here was to visually underscore the impressive width of the rear of the car and this was achieved by drawing on a layering concept.",
            "One of the layers is the fixed rear wing, a solution not seen on a street legal Ferrari since the 1995 F50. The second is the body-coloured profile that wraps around a light-bar, an element that is a complete departure from the twin-taillight concept of the SF90 Stradale. The third layer, already seen on the SF90, is the blown spoiler combined with an active aero concept known as a shut-off Gurney.",
            "Carbon-fibre elements stand out from bodywork colour elements all over the car, but most especially in its lower section, to underscore the car's technical aspects. Other connotative elements are the air vents in the shape of rounded-off quadrangles on both the front bonnet and rear engine lid, which effectively become a part of the car's livery. They are designed as touches of colour that coordinate with the end plates on the carbon-fibre rear wing, for instance. The car also sports specific star-burst wheel rims with prominent aerodynamic profiles.",
            "INTERIOR",
            "The guiding principle of the Ferrari SF90 XX Stradale's interior design was highlighting the cockpit's racing vocation through solutions that would provide significant weight-savings. The main areas involved were the door panels, tunnel and mats, which are now simpler in terms of their shape and the mainly technical fabrics used, while carbon-fibre was used for functional areas. The upper part of the dashboard is trimmed in Alcantara®, while the lower part is trimmed in technical fabric. Both are inspired by the racing world.",
            "The door panels emphasise the theme seen aboard the SF90 Stradale: the concave sections that converge on the dashboard are highlighted by the colour contrast. The three louvres in the middle zone, on the other hand are a nod to the air vents on the wheel arch, creating an overall dynamic, sculptural effect. The three apertures, which reference the exterior language, also seamlessly integrate technical and control functions, in a completely new stylistic interpretation.",
            "The pared-back central tunnel not only looks, but is exceptionally light. It is dominated by the gear shift gate which is located now centrally and more forward on the tunnel compared to the SF90 Stradale. The window lifters and the key compartment are on a secondary level. The styling theme is characterised by volumes that create a sophisticated combination of functional voids and structural solids, lending the tunnel a sporty yet sophisticated appeal while still highlighting its functionality.",
            "A specific racing seat with a visible carbon-fibre tubular structure and cushion supports was designed for the car to enhance sporty driving pleasure without compromising on comfort. The backrest rake mechanism has been integrated into the seat using elastic trim materials which hide the separation between the backrest and seat squab. This means that the structure looks seamless at all times - just like a single-piece seat while also allowing the backrest to be adjusted. Together with the carbon-fibre structure, this feature saved 1.3 kg in weight compared to the SF90 Stradale's single-piece seat.",
            "SF90 XX Spider",
            "The SF90 XX Spider allowed the Ferrari Styling Centre to use the modifications made to the rear of the car to create an instantly recognisable architecture in which the flying buttress, a much-loved part of Ferrari tradition, seamlessly melds with the arrow theme of the front. The resulting visual effect extends the body forwards and lending it a completely different connotation to the SF90 XX Stradale.",
            "The car's centre of gravity thus appears to be lower too, particularly from the side. This is not just because of the roof, which has a wraparound windscreen that seamlessly melds with the side windows, but also because the flying buttresses are lower than on the SF90 XX Stradale. Although the roll-bars protrude from the rest of the bodywork when the roof is lowered, the fact that they are carbon-fibre means they don't sully the broad, squat look created by the flying buttresses. This in turn enhances the visual lowering of the car's volume.",
            "When the roof is up, the roll-bars seamlessly connect to and become one with the roof structure. Like the roll-bars, the top is carbon-fibre and thanks to the renowned Ferrari Retractable Hard Top (RHT) mechanism, can be opened while the car is moving in a mere 14 seconds at a speed of up to 45 km/h, allowing occupants to enjoy the car to the utmost in all kinds of weather.",

            "At Audi, \"performance\" means more power. Larger turbochargers and an increase in boost pressure from 2.4 to 2.6 bar in the 4.0-liter V8 biturbo TFSI engine of the Audi RS7 Sportback performance allow an increase of 30 PS in engine power and 50 Nm more torque compared to the base version.

The mechanical center differential distributes engine power to the rear axle at ratio of 40 : 60, and if slippage occurs, more torque is automatically applied to the axle with better traction - up to 70 percent can flow to the front axle and up to 85 percent to the rear axle. The self-locking center differential is lighter and more compact, improving driving dynamics as well as offering noticeably more precise cornering which makes for less understeer at the handling limits. As an added improvement, the steering response is more exact with customers benefitting from a more agile driving experience overall.",
            "Exclusive and performing: 22-inch wheels with high-performance tires",
            "The new Audi RS7 Sportback performance rides on standard 21-inch aluminum cast wheels in a ten-spoke star design and 275/35 tires. Besides 22-inch cast aluminum wheels, 22-inch lightweight wheels are also available for an even sportier look - in burnished glossy metallic black, matte gray, matte black, or matte neodymium gold. Inspired by motorsport, the airy 5-Y spoke design aids brake cooling and the lighter rims are manufactured in a high-tech forging-milling process. The new lightweight wheel is around five kilograms (11 lbs) lighter than the 22-inch aluminum wheel on the current RS7 Sportback - this 20-kilogram (44 lbs) weight reduction in unsprung mass improves throttle response.",
            "New high-performance Continental \"Sport Contact 7\" 285/30 tires, which are part of the new lightweight wheel, play a key role in reducing weight. The tires offer consistently better grip on both dry and wet roads and reduce understeering when cornering at speed, making for overall more precise handling across the entire speed range. Additionally, the stopping distance is up to two meters shorter with the new wheels when braking from 100 to 0 km/h (62.1 to 0 mph).",

For example, the gliding mode now only activates automatically in the efficiency profile, which means in speed ranges up to 160 km/h (99.4 mph), it switches off the combustion engine and coasts with no fuel consumption or drag from the engine. Additionally, fine-tuning to the engine control unit software makes for tighter load changes in S mode when the dynamic drive select mode or driving mode S is active, further heightening driving emotion. The updated software in the transmission control unit makes for faster shifting times and a noticeably increased contrast between the various driving modes.",

The noticeable width is no optical illusion - at 1,950 millimeters (76.8 in) at the front fenders, the tape measure has to stretch an extra 20 millimeters (0.8 in) on each side over the Audi A7 Sportback. The RS7 Sportback and the RS7 Sportback performance share the coupé-like lines of the base model's body but have only four identical parts: the hood, the roof, the front doors, and the tailgate. The RS-specific exterior design lends the 5,009-millimeter (197.2-inch) grand tourer a character all its own.",
            "The front end of the RS7 Sportback and the RS7 Sportback performance features a broader and flatter Singleframe than the A7 Sportback, with no contrasting chrome border. The radiator protective grille with its RS-specific three-dimensional honeycomb structure has retained its glossy black appearance. Inspired by the Audi R8 supercar, distinctive air inlets on the front end with glossy black vertical wings emphasize the powerful styling. A horizontal blade marks a distinctive downward edge to the front end.",
            "The side view of the Audi RS7 Sportback and the RS7 Sportback performance reveals sharply defined lines and curved surfaces appearing like well-toned muscles. A low shoulder line shifts the visual emphasis downward, while the window line rises toward the rear, giving a sense of dynamism even when the vehicle is stationary. The RS specific door sills with black inlays accentuate the high-performance Sportback's distinct impression of forward movement.",
            "The rear end's sweeping spoiler lip and strip of lights linking the main rear lights together are among the characteristic defining features of the RS7 Sportback and RS7 Sportback performance.

            "The RS7 Sportback and the RS7 Sportback performance roll off the assembly line with LED headlights as standard. The daytime running light signature consists of twelve light segments that are positioned vertically next to each other, separated by narrow spaces - conjuring up an association with the ones and zeroes of the digital world. In the lower zone are the turn signals and the two-line Matrix high beam, which is made up of 32 individually controllable LEDs. They illuminate the road dynamically and precisely while leaving other road users out of the cone of their light. The LEDs also act as cornering lights. The tinted HD matrix LED headlights with Audi laser light and the LED rear lights are equipped with dynamic turn signal lights and run through RS-specific sequences when the vehicle is locked and unlocked.",
            "The Audi laser light, recognizable by the blue marker in the reflector, doubles the range of the high-beams. In each headlight, a small laser module generates a light cone that acts as a spotlight extending several hundred meters. The monochromatic and coherent blue laser beam has a wavelength of 450 nanometers. A phosphor converter converts it into soft light suitable for roadway use with a color temperature of 5,500 kelvin, ideal for the human eye. This enables the driver to recognize contrasts more effectively and helps to prevent fatigue. The laser spotlight, which is activated at speeds of more than 70 km/h (43.5 mph), offers tremendous advantages in terms of visibility and safety. If the camera on the windshield detects other vehicles within range, the laser spotlight is dimmed automatically.",
            "The rear lights on the large grand tourer also appear digital. Each unit comprises 13 vertical segments that alternate with the brake light, which is also segmented. The LED light strip - an homage to the Sport quattro - interconnects the lighting units. The rear fog light is positioned in the center, as on a racing car.",

The high performance Sportcoupé will sprint from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62.1 mph) in only 3.6 seconds and will continue on to 200 km/h (124.3 mph) in just 12 seconds. The top speed is electronically limited to 250 km/h (155.3 mph). The optional dynamic package increases the top speed to 280 km/h (174.0 mph) or even up to 305 km/h (189.5 mph) with the RS dynamic package plus.",
            "Larger turbochargers and an increase in boost pressure from 2.4 to 2.6 bar in the 4.0-liter V8 biturbo TFSI engine that the Audi RS7 Sportback performance boast, allow an increase of 30 PS in engine power and 50 Nm more torque compared to the base versions. This means a total increase in power from 441 kW (600 PS) to 463 kW (630 PS) and in maximum torque from 800 to 850 Nm. The performance model sprint from 0 to 100 km/h in 3.4 seconds, 0.2 seconds faster than the RS7 base version.",

Its crankcase is made of cast aluminum and weighs just 39.1 kilograms (86.2 lb). The cylinder linings have been machined with the aid of atmospheric plasma spraying. This method involves applying an extremely thin iron coating to the cylinder linings. These coated cylinder linings improve heat dissipation, thermal and mechanical resilience, and wear resistance. They also significantly reduce internal friction and oil consumption. An electronic valve located centrally in the inside V also regulates the map-controlled piston spray nozzles as required for piston cooling.",
            "When the driver steps on the accelerator, the belt alternator starter will start the engine again. MHEV technology allows for start/stop operation at a speed of up to 22 km/h (13.7 mph). In everyday driving, it is possible to achieve fuel savings of up to 0.8 liters per 100 kilometers.",
            "The cylinder on demand (COD) system is another measure onboard the vehicle that benefits efficiency. In higher gears at low to medium loads and engine speeds, it will switch off cylinders 2, 3, 5, and 8 by halting injection and ignition and closing the intake and exhaust valves. In four-cylinder operation, the operating points in the active cylinders are shifted toward higher loads in areas of the ECU map with higher efficiency, while the deactivated cylinders largely run without losses, like gas springs. They are reactivated immediately when the driver presses the accelerator. Each switchover takes mere milliseconds and is virtually undetectable by the driver and passengers.",
            "The twin-turbocharged four-liter-V8 engine in the Audi RS7 Sportback and the Audi RS7 Sportback performance produces a full-bodied and sporty V8 sound. The driver can precisely influence the sonorous sound of the power unit via the Audi drive select dynamic handling system. The optional RS sport exhaust system with black tailpipe trim provides an even fuller sound. In the customizable RS1 and RS2 modes, customers decide themselves whether the sound should be sporty or balanced.",
            "Transmission",
            "The power produced by the 4.0 TFSI is delivered via the standard eight-speed tiptronic transmission with optimized gear changing and a launch control function to the quattro permanent all-wheel drive system. Drive forces are distributed to the front and rear axles in a 40 : 60 ratio via the purely mechanical center differential. In the event of slip, more drive torque automatically goes to the axle with the better traction. Up to 70 percent can be directed to the front wheels and up to 85 percent to the rear wheels.",
            "Wheel-selective torque control, a software system that operates on all kinds of road surfaces, optimizes the agile and confident handling of the RS7 Sportback and RS7 Sportback performance. It electronically applies the brakes to the wheels in a gentle manner on the inside of the bend before they can begin to slip. The difference in drive forces turns the car into the bend, allowing the car to follow the steering angle precisely. The result: precise, agile, and neutral handling.",
            "In the optional RS dynamic package and RS dynamic package plus, Audi combines wheel-selective torque control with the quattro sport differential. It distributes the drive torque between the rear wheels as needed during dynamic cornering, thereby improving handling, traction, and stability. A superposition gear comprising two sun gears and an internal gear was mounted on the left and the right of a conventional rear differential. It turns 10 percent faster than the drive shaft.",
            "A multi-plate clutch in an oil bath and operated by an electrohydraulic actuator provides the power connection between the shaft and the superposition gear. When the clutch closes, it steplessly forces the higher speed of the superposition stage on the gear. Being forced to turn faster results in the additional torque required being drawn off from the opposing wheel on the inside of the curve via the differential. In this way nearly all of the torque can be directed to one wheel.",
            "The sport differential can distribute the torque between the left and right rear wheels in all operating states, including while decelerating. When turning or accelerating in a curve, they are predominantly steered toward the wheel on the outside of the curve - the car is literally pressed into the curve, eliminating even the slightest hint of understeer. In case of oversteer, the sport differential stabilizes the vehicle by shifting torque to the wheel on the inside of the curve.",
            "In the RS7 Sportback and the RS7 Sportback performance, the sport differential is controlled from the electronic chassis platform. The software for the sport differential constantly computes the distribution of torque at the rear axle that is ideal for driving dynamics. This takes into account the steering angle, yaw rate, lateral acceleration and driving speed. Networking with Audi drive select allows the driver to influence how the system works.",
            "RS Dynamic Package as standard",
            "The RS Dynamic Package is standard equipment in the RS7 performance. This includes the increase in top speed to 280 km/h (174 mph), dynamic all-wheel steering (the RS-specific software update helps the driver with active steering corrections on the front and rear axles), and the quattro sport differential on the rear axle.",

Customers can order the calipers in gray, red, or blue and discs measure 440 mm (17.3 in) at the front and 370 mm (14.6 in) at the rear. The RS ceramic brake system weights a total of approx. 34 kg (75.0 lbs) less than its steel counterpart for a reduction of the unsprung mass.",
            "New self-locking center differential in the Audi RS7 Sportback performance",
            "Power from the 4.0 TFSI engine flows through a standard eight-speed tiptronic with faster shift times to the permanent all-wheel drive quattro. The strictly mechanical center differential distributes engine power to the rear axle at ratio of 40 : 60 and if wheelspin occurs, more drive torque is automatically applied to the axle with better traction - up to 70 percent can flow to the front axle and up to 85 percent to the rear axle. The self-locking center differential is lighter and more compact, improving driving dynamics plus offering noticeably more precise cornering which makes for less understeer at the handling limits. As an added improvement, the self-steering response is more exact with passengers benefitting from a more agile driving experience overall.",
            "Suspension",
            "The front and rear axles handle the longitudinal and transverse forces independently. They both use a five-link design. The linkages and the subframes are made largely of aluminum. The track width of the Audi RS7 Sportback and Audi RS7 Sportback performance is 1,668 millimeters (65.7 in) at the front and 1,650 millimeters (65.0 in) at the rear.",
            "The standard RS adaptive air suspension with controlled damping has been given taut tuning specifically to suit the RS. Thanks to an air spring module with a 50 percent higher spring rate, the RS7 Sportback can reach a top speed of 305 km/h (189.5 mph) for the first time with the dynamic package plus and with RS adaptive air suspension. The electronic chassis platform (ECP) acts as the central control mechanism that regulates the way in which the dampers work to suit the road condition, the driver's personal driving style, and the Audi drive select mode currently enabled. The air suspension also includes automatic level control. In the normal position in auto, comfort, and efficiency modes, the body of the RS7 Sportback and the RS7 Sportback performance sit 10 millimeters (0.4 in) lower with both types of suspension than an Audi A7 Sportback with standard suspension. At speeds of 120 km/h (74.6 mph) and above, the air suspension lowers the body another 10 millimeters (0.4 in) in the auto, comfort, and efficiency modes. In dynamic mode, the body remains at this low ride height permanently. On poor road surfaces, the RS adaptive air suspension features a lift that can raise the RS7 Sportback and RS7 Sportback performance by 20 millimeters (0.8 in) at low speed.",
            "The RS sport suspension plus with Dynamic Ride Control (DRC) is available as an performance-oriented alternative. It positions the body of the RS7 Sportback and the RS7 Sportback performance another 4 millimeters (0.2 in) lower than the RS sport air suspension. Dynamic Ride Control offers integrated pitch and roll stabilization consisting of steel springs and three-way adjustable dampers that counteract the movements of the vehicle body with no delay, without the use of electronics. When the vehicle is turning into and traveling around a bend, the damper response is altered so that the vehicle's movements on the longitudinal axis (roll) and transverse axis (pitch) are significantly reduced.",
            "The dampers on one side of the vehicle are connected to the dampers diagonally opposite to them via two separate oil lines, each of which has a central valve. The valves provide the necessary compensating volume via internal pistons with the gas-filled compartment behind them. When turning into and traveling around a corner, an oil flow is generated between the diagonally opposite dampers via the central valve, thus creating additional damping force.",
            "When one side is cushioned, the damping characteristics are altered such that roll and pitch movements are eliminated almost entirely. As a result, this highly responsive damper system ensures the high-performance coupé has particularly good track stability when negotiating bends.",
            "The RS7 Sportback and RS7 Sportback performance use next-generation dampers. Thanks to an integrated valve, they are lighter and more compact as well as more effective at reducing pitch and roll movements. In addition, they enable the damping forces to be spread even more widely between the comfort and dynamic modes as well as more precise suspension adjustment for high damping forces, which occur when cornering at speed. The result: In comfort mode, the RS sport suspension with Dynamic Ride Control (DRC) ensures amazing ride comfort. In the dynamic program, it delivers extraordinary driving precision even when cornering at high speed. With the aid of Audi drive select, the driver can influence the damper characteristics and thereby personalize the driving experience.",
            "Progressive steering with sporty and direct ratios is a standard feature of the RS7 Sportback and the RS7 Sportback performance. Its specially toothed gear rack varies the ratio as a function of the steering angle in a range from 12.6 : 1 to 15.8 : 1. As steering wheel turn increases, the ratio decreases, and steering becomes more direct. This reduces steering effort in urban traffic and when maneuvering; in tight curves the car is even more agile. Here, progressive steering provides for sporty handling. It also adjusts the power assistance level as a function of driving speed. It is increased at low speeds for easier maneuverability. The steering assistance can be varied between several modes with the Audi drive select dynamic handling system.",
            "The sporty grand tourer can optionally be fitted with dynamic all-wheel steering. It combines direct, sporty steering response with unshakable stability, resolving an age-old conflict of objectives. At the front axle, dynamic steering features strain wave gearing with a ratio that changes depending on the situation. The combination of dynamic steering and rear-axle steering changes the overall steering ratio within a range of 9.5 to 17.0 - from very direct at low speeds to extremely stable at high speeds. This steering system also ensures that the rear wheels turn a few degrees in the same or opposite direction relative to the front wheels depending on the vehicle's speed. At low speeds the rear wheels turn as much as five degrees in the opposite direction relative to the front wheels. This reduces the turning circle by up to 1 meter (3.3 ft). As a result, the RS7 Sportback and the RS7 Sportback performance negotiate bends with even more agility. At intermediate and high speeds above around 100 km/h (62.1 mph), the rear wheels follow the movement of the front wheels by up to two degrees. This gives the RS7 Sportback improved stability, handling, and safety.",
            "With the Audi drive select dynamic handling system, the driver can influence the characteristics of both steering variants as well as other aspects of the RS7 Sportback the RS7 Sportback performance.",
            "There are six profiles available: efficiency, comfort, auto, dynamic, and two customizable, RS-specific RS1 and RS2 modes. Once these have been set to suit the driver's personal preferences and stored, they can be enabled directly via the RS MODE button on the steering wheel. Consequently, the driver can easily switch between the RS1, RS2, and last selected drive modes without having to operate the MMI touch response again. Audi drive select influences the engine and transmission management, the power steering, the suspension, the dynamic all-wheel steering, the quattro sport differential, the engine sound, and the way in which the automatic air conditioning works. In RS2 mode, customers can also switch the Electronic Stabilization Control (ESC) to sport mode at the touch of a button and save this setting permanently. Pressing the button for longer than three seconds completely deactivates the electronic stability control.",
            "But the experience of the driving modes in the performance models is much more unique. For example, the coasting mode now only activates automatically in the efficiency profile, which means in speed ranges up to 160 km/h (99.4 mph), it switches off the combustion engine and coasts with no fuel consumption or drag torque from the engine. Additionally, fine-tuning to the engine control unit software makes for tighter load changes in S mode when the dynamic drive select mode or driving mode S is active, further increasing the emotionality. The updated software in the transmission control unit makes for faster shift times and a noticeably increased spread between the various driving modes.",

Additionally, the brake path is up to two meters shorter with the new wheels when braking from 100 to 0 km/h (62.1 to 0 mph). On the front axle, a 10-piston braking system with fixed calipers ensures strong performance and high fade resistance.",
            "The calipers of the standard RS brake system with internally ventilated perforated discs measuring 420 millimeters at the front and 370 millimeters at the rear are painted in black or, on upon request, in red. On the optional RS ceramic brake system, the calipers are finished in a choice of gray, red or blue. Their discs measure 440 millimeters at the front and 370 millimeters at the rear. The anthracite-gray ceramic discs are extremely fade-resistant, powerful, and durable. Air deflectors quickly dissipate heat and improve resistance to fade. Compared with its steel counterpart, the RS ceramic brake system weighs 34 kilograms less, thus reducing unsprung masses.",
            "Body",
            "The body concept for the RS7 combines the best of three worlds: the design of a coupé, the space of a sedan, and the variability of an Avant. The luggage compartment has a base size of 535 liters (18.9 cu ft) and can be expanded up to 1,390 liters (49.1 cu ft) despite a sloping tailgate. The interior is extremely quiet thanks to highly advanced aerodynamics and aeroacoustics. The long tailgate opens and closes electrically as standard or via foot gesture with the optional convenience key.",
            "For the structure of the RS7 Sportback's body, Audi Sport has chosen to use an intelligent mixture of materials. Combined ultra-high-strength hot-formed steel components form the backbone of the passenger compartment, accounting for 23.9 percent of the weight of the structure. It is used primarily in the lower section of the front bulkhead, the side sills, the rear cross member, the B-pillars, and the front zone of the roof line. Here and in other areas of the body, Audi uses sheet metal blanks in many places with variable wall thicknesses between 0.75 and 2.05 millimeters (0.03-0.1 in).",
            "They provide high strength while keeping the weight low. These tailored blanks are created by partial tempering and by complex processes during rolling or welding.",
            "The aluminum components in the body-in-white weigh a total of 10.9 kilograms (24.0 lb). The strut dome and reinforcements in the roof frame are made of cast aluminum, as are the strut brace in the engine compartment and the central cross brace under the floor of extruded sections. An aluminum sheet supports the B-pillars, and the upper shell of the rear roof frame is made of a steel/polymer mix. The doors, hood, and luggage compartment lid are made entirely of the lightweight metal. The curb weight (without driver) of the Audi RS7 Sportback is 2,065 kilograms (4,552.5 lb).",

            "The drag coefficient of the Audi RS7 Sportback is 0.32. The Audi aerodynamics team put a lot of work into all areas, including on the exterior mirrors and the rear axle trim. Small spoilers direct the flow at the underbody, including in front of the wheels.",
            "The outer areas of the air inlets feature additional openings - they guide a portion of the air flow into the wheel arches, where it flows past the wheels. When the spoiler extends electrically at a speed of 100 km/h (62.1 mph), it noticeably reduces lift on the rear axle - even at top speed it is only 40 kilograms (88.2 lb).",
            "The Audi RS7 Sportback features top aeroacoustics thanks to a sophisticated sealing system for the doors and tailgate. Despite the frameless doors, passengers enjoy extraordinary acoustic comfort. Audi installs acoustic glazing 6 millimeters (0.2 in) thick for the front and side windows.",
            "Interior",
            "Much like the exterior design of the Audi RS7 Sportback and the Audi RS7 Sportback performance, the design language in the interior combines taut, sinewy surfaces with clearly defined contours. All the design motifs are logically connected. There is plenty of space for the driver and passenger, with the architecture of the interior accomplishing a seamless transition to the futuristic user interface.",
            "From the Audi A7 Sportback, the RS7 Sportback and the RS7 Sportback performance take their fully digital operating concept called the MMI touch response, which can be operated intuitively like a smartphone with touch and swipe gestures: Two touch displays with haptic and acoustic feedback replace the rotary push-button and many buttons from the previous model.",
            "The upper MMI touch response display is embedded in the black-paneled architecture in a way that renders seeing where the display ends and the surroundings begin almost impossible. The asymmetric console in the center tunnel also stands out with its black-paneled look and houses a second display and a strip of buttons. It and the control panel for the lighting functions are optionally available with touch response technology.",
            "As standard, the driver and front passenger sit on RS sport seats in black pearl Nappa leather/Alcantara with a rhombus pattern and RS embossing.

Optional inlays in natural gray-brown wood or matte aluminum open up a range of possibilities for customizing the interior.",
            "The contour/ambient lighting package is standard in the RS7 Sportback and RS7 Sportback performance. Both bring the interior design to life in the dark and highlight the space, volume, and materials. The ambient light makes the dashboard and center console seem to float, and in the door it enhances the sense of space. The contour light traces the large lines on the center console and in the door panels and can be set to any of 30 colors. RS and RS7 logos adorn the interior on the steering wheel, seats, and the illuminated front door sill trims. Logo projectors on the front and rear doors project the Audi Sport emblem onto the ground when the doors are open.",
            "For the first time, Audi Sport is offering the five-door grand tourer with a three-seat rear bench. The sporty four-seater design with a two-seater rear bench is still available. The luggage compartment offers a base capacity of 535 liters (18.9 cu ft), which can be increased to as much as 1,390 liters (49.1 cu ft) with the split rear seatbacks folded down.",

            "As a smart, high-performance sports car, the RS7 Sportback and the RS7 Sportback performance provide an extensive range of infotainment and connectivity services. The standard MMI navigation plus uses the MIB 2+ modular infotainment platform, with the Audi connect data transfer module integrated as standard. This makes a Wi-Fi hotspot that also supports the 5 GHz band and the fast LTE Advanced transmission standard on the car.",
            "When planning the route, the self-learning navigation system makes suggestions to the driver based on routes driven previously, incorporating experience regarding time of day and traffic density.",
            "The route is calculated online on the servers of the map and navigation service provider HERE, which also considers real-time data concerning the overall traffic situation. If the data connection is lost while the car is on the move, the navigation system will switch to on-board route guidance, which runs in the background.",
            "The driver can access gas stations and parking garages from the navigation system and will see additional information such as fuel prices, availability of parking spaces and business hours.",
            "In the first three years after the car is purchased, the map can be updated four times per year free of charge - over the air at LTE Advanced speed, if desired.

Voice-over-LTE helps to connect faster and makes it possible to use high-speed data transfer and high-resolution online voice telephony (HD Voice) at the same time.",
            "Driver assist systems",
            "In the RS7 Sportback and the Audi RS7 Sportback performance Audi offers more than 30 driver assistance systems, making driving even more comfortable, efficient, and safe. The systems are split into two packages: \"Tour\" and \"City\".",
            "The adaptive cruise assist (ACA) is the most important system in the Tour assist package. It adds a lane-tracking function that also helps out in traffic jams to the adaptive cruise control (ACC). At speeds between 0 and 250 km/h (155.3 mph), the system keeps the Audi RS7 Sportback* at the desired distance to the vehicle ahead. It also makes slight steering corrections to help the driver to stay in the lane and provides longitudinal guidance through road construction sites by means of the narrowed road assist.",
            "The Audi pre sense basic and Audi pre sense front safety systems come standard. They detect collision hazards all around the car and initiate targeted preventive measures - whether maximum braking, adjusting the seats, or tightening the belts. Audi pre sense front includes a warning and braking function for vehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists. The emergency assist brings the car to a stop if the driver is no longer able to do so.",
            "Behind the assistance systems in the RS7 Sportback and the RS7 Sportback performance are the central driver assistance controller (zFAS) and a portfolio of sensors that complement each other with their respective strengths. The data from the various sensors flow together in the zFAS.",
            "With its high-end processors, the tablet-sized computer continually computes a differentiated image of the vehicle's surroundings. This centralized environment model enables the assistance systems to further improve their performance compared to the predecessor model, for example, when they detect the end of a traffic jam and initiate braking. Also, navigation is even more precise, because the sensor data fusion locates your own car down to the exact lane."

            "At Audi, \"performance\" means more power. Larger turbochargers and an increase in boost pressure from 2.4 to 2.6 bar in the 4.0-liter V8 biturbo TFSI engine of the Audi RS6 Avant performance allow an increase of 30 PS in engine power and 50 Nm more torque compared to the base version. This means total power rises from 441 kW (600 PS) to 463 kW (630 PS) and maximum torque rises from 800 to 850 Nm (590 to 627 lb-ft). The performance model sprint from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62.1 mph) in 3.4 seconds, 0.2 seconds faster than the RS6 base version.",
            "Less is sometimes more: Reduced insulation between the engine compartment, the interior, and the rear of the vehicle ensures the RS6 Avant performance will thrill customers with an exciting, next-level sound experience - the reduction also makes the car eight kilograms (17.6 lbs) lighter. The RS6 Avant performance has a total unladen weight of 2,090 kg (4,608 lbs).",

            "Power from the 4.0 TFSI engine flows through a standard eight-speed tiptronic with faster shifting times to the quattro permanent all-wheel drive system.",
            "The mechanical center differential distributes engine power to the rear axle at ratio of 40 : 60, and if slippage occurs, more torque is automatically applied to the axle with better traction - up to 70 percent can flow to the front axle and up to 85 percent to the rear axle. The self-locking center differential is lighter and more compact, improving driving dynamics as well as offering noticeably more precise cornering, which makes for less understeering at the handling limits. As an added improvement, the steering response is more exact with passengers benefitting from a more agile driving experience overall.",
            "Exclusive and performing: 22-inch wheels with high-performance tires",
            "The new Audi RS6 Avant performance roll off the line on standard 21-inch aluminum cast wheels in a ten-spoke star design and 275/35 tires. Besides 22-inch cast aluminum wheels, 22-inch lightweight wheels are also available for an even sportier look - in burnished glossy metallic black, matte gray, matte black, or matte neodymium gold. Inspired by motorsport, the airy 5-Y spoke design aids brake cooling and the lighter rims are manufactured in a high-tech forging-milling process. The new lightweight wheel is around five kilograms (11 lbs) lighter than the 22-inch aluminum wheel on the current RS6 Avant - this 20-kilogram (44 lbs) weight reduction in unsprung masses improves the throttle response.",
            "New high-performance Continental \"Sport Contact 7\" 285/30 tires, which are part of the new lightweight wheel, play a key role in reducing weight. The tires offer consistently better grip on both dry and wet roads and reduce understeering when cornering at speed, making for overall more precise handling across the entire speed range. Additionally, the brake path is up to two meters shorter with the new wheels when braking from 100 to 0 km/h (62.1 to 0 mph).",
            "The Audi drive select dynamic handling system lets the driver control the vehicle's character. Six profiles are available: efficiency, comfort, auto, dynamic, as well as two customizable RS-specific RS1 and RS2 modes.",
            "But experience of the driving modes in the performance model is much more unique. For example, the coasting mode now only activates automatically in the efficiency profile, which means in speed ranges up to 160 km/h (99.4 mph), it switches off the combustion engine and coasts with no fuel consumption or drag torque from the engine. Additionally, fine-tuning to the engine control unit software makes for tighter load changes in S mode when the dynamic drive select mode or driving mode S is active, further heightening driving emotion. The updated software in the transmission control unit makes for faster shifting times and a noticeably increased spread between the various driving modes.",

            "This means a total increase in power from 441 kW (600 PS) to 463 kW (630 PS) and in maximum torque from 800 to 850 Nm. The performance model sprint from 0 to 100 km/h in 3.4 seconds, 0.2 seconds faster than the RS6 base version.",
            "The twin-turbo V8 engine has a conventional 90-degree bank angle and a displacement of 3,996 cc (bore x stroke: 86.0 x 86.0 millimeters (3.4 in x 3.4 in)). Its crankcase is made of cast aluminum and weighs just 39.1 kilograms (86.2 lb). The cylinder linings have been machined with the aid of atmospheric plasma spraying. This method involves applying an extremely thin iron coating to the cylinder linings. These coated cylinder linings improve heat dissipation, thermal and mechanical resilience, and wear resistance. They also reduce internal friction significantly and ensure minimum oil consumption. An electronic valve located centrally in the inside V also regulates the map-controlled piston spray nozzles as required for piston cooling. This decreases the power requirements of the oil pump.",
            "A fully variable pump drives the oil circuit. It is split into two separate oil galleries - one for the engine block and one for the cylinder heads. This layout ensures a reliable supply of oil even under the extreme lateral and longitudinal acceleration that the Audi RS6 Avant and the RS6 Avant performance is capable of achieving. The switchable water pump is only engaged from a temperature of 80 degrees Celsius (176 °F), as the coolant, which is stagnant at first, heats up more quickly and the engine reaches its operating temperature sooner. The chains of the valve gear are driven by a geared intermediate shaft. This also drives the water pump. To ensure that the cylinders are filled optimally, intake and exhaust camshafts can be adjusted by 50 degrees. Each cylinder bank drives a high-pressure fuel pump that builds up pressure of up to 250 bar. The injectors, located in the center of the combustion chamber, inject the fuel through seven holes, following special injection strategies depending on the requirements, from cold start to full load. The firing order is the same as that of the predecessor engine: 1-3-7-2-6-5-4-8.",
            "The 4.0 TFSI produces a full-bodied and sporty V8 sound. The driver can influence the full sound of the power unit using the Audi drive select dynamic handling system. The Audi drive select system influences the engine and transmission management, the power steering, the suspension, the dynamic all-wheel steering, the quattro sport differential, the engine sound, and the way in which the automatic air conditioning works. The optional RS sport exhaust system with black tailpipe trim provides an even fuller sound. In the customizable RS1 and RS2 modes, customers decide themselves whether the four-liter engine should sound sporty or balanced.",
            "Forceful: two twin-scroll turbochargers",
            "The powerful torque that the 4.0 TFSI builds up even at slow speeds is mainly owed to the two twin-scroll turbochargers. In addition to elevated boost pressure, the diameter of the compressor wheel of the turbochargers has been increased by three millimeters (0.1 in). Each turbo supplies one cylinder bank with up to 1.4 bar of boost pressure (relative). This is 0.2 bar more than the predecessor. The increased boost pressure allows more air into the combustion chamber for the fuel combustion, which improves the fill level of the cylinders. This results in higher engine power and improved efficiency.",
            "The cylinder heads have the intake side on the outside and the exhaust side on the inside. This allows the larger turbos and their optimized air-to-air intercooler to be located in the 90-degree inside V of the cylinder banks rather than in the usual location outside the side of the engine. This layout enables short gas flow paths with minimal flow losses and spontaneous engine response. Elaborate and effective insulation of hot components ensures thermally stable conditions in the inside V. The compression ratio is 10.1 : 1 for the RS6 Avant and 9.7 : 1 for the RS6 Avant performance.",
            "Efficient systems: MHEV and cylinder on demand (COD)",
            "Thanks to its mild hybrid system (MHEV) with a 48-volt main on-board electrical system, the 4.0 TFSI combines maximum performance with high efficiency. The heart of this system, the belt alternator starter, can recover up to 12 kW of power under gentle acceleration and feed it into a lithium-ion battery as energy.",
            "If the driver releases the accelerator at a speed between 55 and 160 km/h (34.2 to 99.4 mph), the drive management will select one of two options. Depending on the driving situation and the settings in the Audi drive select dynamic handling system, the RS6 Avant and RS6 Avant performance recovers, i.e. the alternator converts kinetic energy into electric energy so that it decelerates, or it coasts with the engine switched off. Pressing the accelerator makes the belt alternator starter restart the engine.",
            "MHEV technology allows for start/stop operation even in all ranges below a residual speed of 22 km/h (13.7 mph). Fuel savings of up to 0.8 liters per 100 kilometers are possible in everyday driving.",
            "The cylinder on demand (COD) system is another measure onboard the vehicle that benefits efficiency. In higher gears at low to medium loads and engine speeds, it will switch off cylinders 2, 3, 5, and 8 by halting injection and ignition and closing the intake and exhaust valves. Due to the four-cylinder operation, the operating points in the active cylinders are displaced toward higher loads in areas of the characteristic map with higher efficiency, while the deactivated cylinders largely run without losses, like gas springs. When the driver presses the accelerator pedal, they are reactivated instantly. Each switchover takes mere milliseconds and is virtually undetectable by the driver and passengers.",
            "Transmission",
            "The power produced by the 4.0 TFSI is delivered via the standard eight-speed tiptronic transmission with optimized gear changing to the quattro permanent all-wheel drive system. A purely mechanical center differential distributes the forces to the front axle and rear axle at a ratio of 40 : 60. In the event of slip, more drive torque automatically goes to the axle with the better traction. Up to 70 percent can be directed to the front wheels, or up to 85 percent to the rear wheels.",
            "The agile and reliable handling of the RS6 Avant and RS6 Avant performance is optimized by the wheel-selective torque control, which applies slight braking pressure to the wheels on the inside of the curve before they slip. This guides the torque to the wheel on the opposite side. In the optional RS dynamic package and RS dynamic package plus, Audi combines wheel-selective torque control with the quattro sport differential. The software of the sport differential calculates the ideal distribution of torque at the rear axle in terms of the vehicle dynamics continuously and thereby increases vehicle dynamics, traction, and stability. The sport differential features a conventional rear differential on both sides supplemented by a superimposed stage. It comprises two sun gears and an internal gear and rotates roughly ten percent faster than the drive shaft.",
            "A multi-plate clutch in an oil bath and operated by an electrohydraulic actuator provides the power connection between the shaft and the superposition gear. When the clutch closes, it steplessly forces the higher speed of the superposition stage on the gear. Being forced to turn faster results in the additional torque required being drawn off from the opposing wheel on the inside of the curve via the differential. In this way nearly all of the torque can be directed to one wheel. The sport differential can distribute the torque between the left and right rear wheels in all operating states, including overrun. When turning or accelerating in a curve, they are predominantly steered toward the wheel on the outside of the curve - the car is literally pressed into the curve, counteracting even any hint of understeer. In case of oversteer, the sport differential stabilizes the vehicle by shifting torque to the wheel on the inside of the curve.",
            "In the RS6 Avant and RS6 Avant performance all suspension components are actuated via the electronic chassis platform. The electronic chassis platform (ECP), which is installed in many Audi models with a longitudinal engine, is the central control unit for the suspension. To do this, it takes into account the speed, yaw rate, lateral acceleration, roll and pitching movements of the vehicle, the steering angle, coefficient of friction of the road surface, the current driving conditions, such as understeer or oversteer, as well as the data from the suspension systems involved. Based on this data, it calculates the optimum adjustment of these components. The benefits for the customer include more precise cornering behavior, increased vehicle dynamics, and a high level of ride comfort. Networking with Audi drive select allows the driver to influence how the system works.",
            "New self-locking center differential in the Audi RS6 Avant performance",
            "Power from the 4.0 TFSI engine flows through a standard eight-speed tiptronic with faster shifting times to the permanent all-wheel drive quattro. The strictly mechanical center differential distributes engine power to the rear axle at ratio of 40 : 60 and if slippage occurs, more drive torque is automatically applied to the axle with better traction - up to 70 percent can flow to the front axle and up to 85 percent to the rear axle. The self-locking center differential is lighter and more compact. It improves driving dynamics and offers noticeably more precise cornering which makes for less understeering at the handling limits.",
            "As an added improvement, the self-steering response is more exact with passengers benefitting from a more agile driving experience overall.",
            "Exterior design",
            "The body style of the Audi RS6 Avant and RS6 Avant performance is peerless in its segment. Even at a standstill, the high-performance Avant from Audi Sport GmbH exudes great desirability. As compared to the basic model, the Audi A6 Avant, the RS model features a strongly differentiated design with numerous RS-specific exterior parts. The RS6 Avant and the A6 Avant have only the front doors, the roof, and the tailgate in common.",
            "The wheel arches, flared by around 40 mm (1.6 in) on each side, emphasize the sporty spirit of the high-performance Avant and further highlight its distinct character. The 22-inch wheels correspond perfectly with the striking proportions and the athletic silhouette of the RS6 Avant.",
            "The Singleframe is considerably flatter and wider when compared to the A6 Avant's. Its radiator protective grille with the RS-specific three-dimensional honeycomb structure features a glossy black design. Vertical glossy black wings are integrated in the striking lateral air inlets that, inspired by the Audi R8, extend almost all the way to the bottom of the headlights. The horizontal blade creates a clear cut between the vehicle and the road.",
            "In addition to the engine hood with its sculpted powerdome, the RS6 Avant also adopts the front headlights from the A7 model line. They not only come with a flatter and therefore even sportier expression, but also offer the option of HD Matrix LED headlights with Audi laser light and darkened bezels as an additional USP of the RS6 Avant within the A6 family.",
            "Pure athleticism: the Avant silhouette with the RS look",
            "The side view of the Audi RS6 Avant and RS6 Avant performance reveals the most athletic interpretation of an Avant silhouette to date, with the elongated front section, the long straight roof line, and the flat D-pillars that are supported by the muscular quattro blister. The low shoulder line that rises slightly toward the rear shifts the visual focus downward. RS-specific sills with black inserts on the sides visually emphasize the pronounced forward thrust. A roof edge spoiler and an RS-specific bumper with rear diffuser and design elements in glossy black form the dynamic rear end. In hallmark RS style, the RS exhaust system flows on both sides into oval chrome-colored tailpipes - an RS sport exhaust system with black tailpipes is available as an option.",
            "The paint range for the Audi RS6 Avant comes with thirteen colors, including the two RS- specific colors Nardo Gray and Sebring Black, Crystal Effect along with a choice of five matte effect paint finishes. The exterior mirror housings come standard in black and are optionally also available in the body color or matte aluminum.",
            "The matte aluminum, black and carbon styling packages change the vertical wings, the horizontal blade, the sill inserts, roof rail, and window slot trims as well as the rear diffuser trim. The Audi rings and the RS logos at the front and rear can also be finished in glossy black as an option for the black and carbon styling packages. The Audi exclusive range offers numerous other customization options.",
            "Fresh exterior colors and styling packages on the RS6 Avant performance",
            "The new Audi RS6 Avant performance is available in a total of 16 exterior colors - for the first time, metallic and matte Ascari Blue and matte Dew Silver are included.The performance models stand out with standard RS exterior components in matte gray, including the exterior mirrors, the front spoiler, the front side flaps, the side sill inserts, the roof rails, and the trim on the side windows and rear diffuser. A matte carbon/black styling package is also an option, in which the roof rails and trim on the side windows are black. The Audi rings and model name are available in the customer's choice of chrome or black.",
            "Lighting technology",
            "The Audi RS6 Avant and RS6 Avant performance come to the customer with LED headlights as standard. The daytime running light signature has a digital character: Twelve light segments are positioned vertically next to each other here, separated by narrow spaces - like the 0 and 1 of the digital world. The turn signals and the two-line Matrix high beam, which is made up of 32 individually controllable LEDs, are located in the lower section of the lighting unit. They illuminate the road dynamically and precisely while hiding other road users from the cone of light automatically. The LEDs also act as cornering lights. The taillights of the high-performance Avant also conjure up associations with the digital world. Each unit comprises nine vertical segments that alternate with the brake lights, which are also segmented.",
            "Both the optional Matrix LED headlights with Audi laser light and darkened bezels and the LED rear lights are equipped with dynamic turn signal lights and run through RS-specific sequences when the vehicle is locked and unlocked. The Audi laser light, recognizable by the blue marker in the reflector, doubles the range of the high beams. In each headlight, a small laser module generates a light cone that acts as a spotlight extending several hundred meters. The monochromatic and coherent blue laser beam has a wavelength of 450 nanometers. A phosphor converter converts it into soft light suitable for roadway use with a color temperature of 5,500 kelvin, ideal for the human eye. This enables the driver to recognize contrasts more effectively and helps to prevent fatigue. The laser spotlight, which is activated at speeds of more than 70 km/h (43.5 mph), offers tremendous advantages in terms of visibility and safety. If the camera on the windshield detects other vehicles within range, the laser spotlight is automatically dimmed.",
            "Suspension",
            "On the Audi RS6 Avant and Audi RS6 Avant performance, the front and rear axles use a five-link design to handle the induced longitudinal and transverse forces separately. The linkages and the subframes are made largely of aluminum. The track width is 1,668 millimeters (5.5 ft) at the front and 1,650 millimeters (5.4 ft) at the rear.",
            "The standard RS adaptive air suspension with controlled damping has been tuned specifically to suit the RS and now allows the RS6 Avant and RS6 Avant performance",
            "to reach a top speed of 305 km/h (189.5 mph) thanks to an air spring module with a 50% higher spring rate (with the dynamic plus package). It can be set to several modes and includes automatic level control. The electronic chassis platform (ECP) acts as the central control mechanism that regulates the way in which the dampers work to suit the road condition, the driver's personal driving style, and the Audi drive select mode currently enabled. The air suspension also includes automatic level control.",
            "In the normal position in auto, comfort, and efficiency modes, the body of the RS6 Avant and RS6 Avant performance sit 20 millimeters (0.8 in) lower with both types of suspension than an A6 Avant with standard suspension. At speeds of 120 km/h (74.6 mph) and above, the air suspension lowers itself by another 10 millimeters (0.4 in) in the three modes specified above. In dynamic mode, the body remains at this low ride height permanently.",
            "On poor road surfaces, the RS adaptive air suspension features a lift that can raise the RS6 Avant and RS6 Avant performance by 20 millimeters (0.8 in) above its normal level at low speeds. The very wide spread of the RS adaptive air suspension offers the driver a free choice between long-distance comfort and maximum performance.",
            "The RS sport suspension plus with Dynamic Ride Control (DRC) is available as an alternative. It lets the RS6 Avant and the RS6 Avant performance hug the road even more tightly and further improves handling. Dynamic Ride Control offers integrated pitch and roll stabilization consisting of steel springs and three-way adjustable dampers that counteract the movements of the vehicle body with no delay, without the use of electronics. When the vehicle is turning into and traveling around a bend, the damper response is altered so that the vehicle's movements on the longitudinal axis (roll) and the transverse axis (pitch) are significantly reduced. The dampers are each connected diagonally to a central valve via two separate oil lines. The valves provide the necessary compensating volume via internal pistons with the gas-filled compartment behind them. When the vehicle is steering into and traveling around a bend, an oil flow is generated between the diagonally opposite dampers via the central valve, thereby creating additional damping force.",
            "When one side is cushioned, the damping characteristics are altered such that roll and pitch movements are eliminated almost entirely. As a result, this highly responsive damper system ensures that the high-performance Avant is particularly precise when negotiating bends.",
            "The generation of dampers with integrated valve has a more compact, lighter design and reduces pitch and rolling movements even more effectively. In addition, it enables the damping forces to be spread even more widely between the comfort, auto, and dynamic modes as well as more precise suspension adjustment for high damping forces, which occur during cornering at speed.",
            "The result: In comfort mode, the RS sport suspension with Dynamic Ride Control (DRC) ensures amazing ride comfort. In the dynamic program, it delivers extraordinary driving precision even when cornering at high speed.",
            "With the aid of the Audi drive select dynamic handling system, the driver can influence the damper characteristics and thereby personalize the driving experience.",
            "The RS6 Avant and the RS6 Avant performance are fitted with progressive steering with a sporty and direct ratio as standard. Its specially designed gear rack varies the ratio depending on the steering angle in a range from 12.6 : 1 to 15.8 : 1. As steering wheel turn increases, the ratio decreases, and the steering becomes more direct. This reduces steering effort in urban traffic and when maneuvering; in tight curves the car is even more agile. Here, progressive steering provides for sporty handling.",
            "It also adjusts the power assistance level as a function of driving speed. It is increased at low speeds for easier maneuverability. The character of the power steering can be varied via the modes of the Audi drive select dynamic handling system.",
            "The RS6 Avant can be equipped with dynamic all-wheel steering as an option. It combines direct, sporty steering response with unshakable stability, resolving an age-old conflict of objectives. At the front axle, dynamic steering features strain wave gearing with a ratio that changes depending on the situation. The combination of dynamic steering and rear-axle steering changes the overall steering ratio within a range of 9.5 to 17.0 - from very direct at low speeds to extremely stable at high speeds. This steering system also ensures that the rear wheels turn a few degrees in the same or opposite direction relative to the front wheels depending on the vehicle's speed. At low speeds, the rear wheels turn as much as five degrees in the opposite direction relative to the front wheels. This reduces the turning circle by up to one meter (3.3 ft).Thus, the RS6 Avant and RS6 Avant performance are even more agile in curves. At intermediate and high speeds above around 100 km/h (62.1 mph), the rear wheels follow the movement of the front wheels by up to two degrees. The RS6 Avant and RS6 Avant performance thereby gains more stability, dynamism, and driving safety.",
            "RS Dynamic Package as standard in the RS6 Avant performance",
            "The RS Dynamic Package is standard equipment in the RS performance. This includes the increase in maximum speed to 280 km/h (180 mph), dynamic all-wheel steering (the RS-specific software update helps the driver with active steering corrections on the front and rear axles), and the quattro sport differential on the rear axle.",
            "The RS Dynamics Package plus is also available as an option, which in addition to the RS Dynamics Package, raises the top speed to 305 km/h (189.5 mph) and includes an RS ceramic brake system.",
            "\"RS MODE\": a button for vehicle dynamics",
            "With the Audi drive select dynamic handling system, the driver can influence the characteristics of both steering variants as well as other aspects of the RS6 Avant and RS6 Avant performance. There are six profiles available: efficiency, comfort, auto, dynamic, as well as two customizable RS-specific RS1 and RS2 modes. Once these have been set to suit the driver's personal preferences and stored in the MMI touch response, they can be enabled directly via quick access to the RS MODE button on the steering wheel. Consequently, the driver can easily switch between the RS1, RS2, and last selected drive select modes without having to operate the MMI touch response again.",
            "The Audi drive select system influences the engine and transmission management, the power steering, the suspension, the dynamic all-wheel steering, the quattro sport differential, the engine sound, and the way in which the automatic air conditioning works. In RS2 mode, customers can also switch the Electronic Stabilization Control (ESC) to sport mode at the touch of a button and save this setting permanently. If the driver presses the ESP button for more than three seconds, the Electronic Stabilization Control is deactivated completely.",
            "But the experience of the driving modes in the performance model is much more unique. For example, the coasting mode now only activates automatically in the efficiency profile, which means in speed ranges up to 160 km/h (99.4 mph), it switches off the combustion engine and coasts with no fuel consumption or drag torque from the engine. Additionally, fine-tuning to the engine control unit software makes for tighter load changes in S mode when the dynamic drive select mode or driving mode S is active, further increasing the emotionality. The updated software in the transmission control unit makes for faster shifting times and a noticeably increased spread between the various driving modes.",
            "Exclusive and highly performing: the wheel program",
            "The RS6 Avant is fitted as standard with 21-inch cast aluminum wheels in 10-spoke star design, which are shod with 275/35 size tires. Audi Sport GmbH is offering an RS-specific wheel in 22-inch 5-V-spoke trapezoid design with 285/30 tires as an option, in a choice of silver, matte titanium look, and glossy anthracite black. At the front axle of the high-performance Avant, a ten-piston fixed-caliper brake system delivers outstanding performance and high stability.",
            "The calipers of the standard RS brake system with internally ventilated and perforated discs (measuring 420 millimeters (16.5 in) at the front and 370 millimeters (14.6 in) at the rear) are painted black, with red available upon request.",
            "On the optional and RS ceramic brake system, the calipers can be gray, red, or blue. The discs measure 440 millimeters (17.3 in) at the front and 370 millimeters (14.6 in) at the rear. The anthracite gray ceramic discs are extremely stable, powerful, and long-lasting. Two air deflector elements attached to the front axle on each side quickly dissipate the heat and improve fading stability. The RS ceramic brake system weighs 34 kilograms (75 lb) less than its steel counterpart. This reduces the unsprung masses and represents a further advantage in terms of light-footed handling.",
            "22-inch wheels with high-performance tires for the performance version",
            "The new RS6 Avant performance roll off the line on standard 21-inch aluminum cast wheels in a ten-spoke star design and 275/35 tires. For an even sportier appearance, 22-inch lightweight wheels are also available, alongside the standard 22-inch aluminum cast wheels - in burnished glossy metallic black, matte gray, matte black, or matte neodymium gold. Inspired by motorsport, the airy 5-Y spoke design aids brake cooling, and the lighter rims are manufactured in a high-tech forging-milling process. The new lightweight wheel is around five kilograms (11 lb) lighter than the 22-inch aluminum wheel on the current RS6 Avant - this 20-kilogram (44.1 lb) weight reduction in unsprung masses improves the throttle response.",
            "New high-performance Continental \"Sport Contact 7\" 285/30 tires, which are part of the new lightweight wheel, play a key role in reducing weight. The tires offer consistently better grip on both dry and wet roads and reduce understeering when cornering at speed, making for overall more precise handling across the entire speed range. Additionally, the brake path is up to two meters shorter with the new wheels when braking from 100 to 0 km/h (62.1 to 0 mph).",
            "Body",
            "The RS6 Avant and RS6 performance measures 4,995 millimeters (16.4 ft) in length, 1,951 millimeters (6.4 ft) in width, and 1,460 millimeters (4.8 ft) in height. In terms of body design, Audi is relying on an intelligent mix of different materials. As a super high strength compound, hot-formed steel components form the backbone of the passenger cell. They reinforce the lower section of the front bulkhead, the side sills, the rear cross member, the B-pillars, and the front zone of the roof line. Here and in other areas of the body, Audi also uses sheet metal blanks with variable wall thicknesses between 0.75 and 2.05 millimeters (0.03 and 0.1 in). These tailored blanks (custom-made sheets) are created by partial tempering and by complex processes during rolling or welding. They provide high strength while keeping the weight low.",
            "The body's higher torsional stiffness contributes to the increased level of comfort and is also the basis for the high vehicle dynamics. The strut domes are cast aluminum; the D-pillar supports are made of aluminum sheet. The doors, hood, and luggage compartment lid are also pure aluminum sheet parts. Empty and without the driver, the RS6 Avant weighs 2,075 kilograms (4,574.6 lb).",
            "The Audi Aerodynamics team put in a lot of work in all areas, from the exterior mirrors on the door rails to the rear axle trim. Small spoilers direct the flow at the underbody, including in front of the front wheels and in front of the spare wheel well. The outer areas of the air inlets feature additional openings - they guide a portion of the air flow into the wheel arches, where it flows past the wheels. The RS6 Avant achieves a drag coefficient of 0.35. Thanks to a sophisticated sealing concept for the doors and tailgate, the high-performance Avant also delivers a top-of-the-range performance in terms of aeroacoustics. Audi offers acoustic glazing six millimeters (0.2 in) thick for the front and side windows from the factory.",
            "Less is sometimes more: Reduced insulation between the engine compartment, the interior, and the rear of the vehicle ensures the RS6 Avant performance will thrill customers with an exciting, next-level sound experience - the reduction also makes the car eight kilograms (17.6 lb) lighter. The RS6 Avant performance has a total unladen weight of 2,090 kg (4,608 lb).",
            "Interior",
            "The luggage compartment has a capacity of between 565 (20.0 cu ft) and 1,680 liters (59.3 cu ft), the loading width between the wheel arches is now 1,050 millimeters (3.4 ft), 14 millimeters (0.6 in) larger than the previous model. The pioneering interior design accentuates with its driver orientation and the inlays in Aluminum Race anthracite the sporty character of the RS6 Avant and the RS6 Avant performance. With its horizontal alignment and the tiered, three-dimensional structure, the instrument panel appears light and sleek. The user interface of the fully digital operating system harmonizes with the clear black panel design, which also includes the glossy asymmetrical console of the center tunnel. It integrates a second display and a strip of buttons. It and the control panel for the lighting functions are optionally available with touch response technology. The top MMI touch response display is incorporated almost invisibly into the black-panel architecture.",
            "As standard, the driver and front passenger sit on RS sport seats in black pearl Nappa leather/Alcantara with a rhombus pattern and RS embossing. The RS sport seats are optionally covered with perforated Valcona leather, featuring a honeycomb pattern and RS embossing. Aside from the seat heating, their perforation also makes a ventilation function possible for the first time.",
            "Red and gray: The design packages",
            "The RS design packages add some color into the cockpit. They offer the steering wheel rim, gear lever gaiter, and knee pads in Alcantara with contrasting stitching in a choice of red or gray. Belt straps with color edging and RS floor mats round out the package. Optional inlays in gray-brown wood or matte aluminum open up a range of possibilities for customizing the interior. The contour ambient lighting package emphasizes the interior of the RS6 Avant in the dark and highlights the space, volume, and materials. The ambient light makes the dashboard and center console seem to float, and in the door it enhances the sense of space. The contour light traces the large lines on the center console and in the door panels and can be set to any of 30 colors. Illuminated seat belt buckles make it easier to find the seat belt buckle in the dark, thereby increasing the level of comfort for the occupants. RS and RS6 logos adorn the interior on the steering wheel, seats, and the illuminated front door sill trims. Projectors at the bottom on the front and rear doors beam the Audi Sport emblem onto the ground when the doors are open.",
            "New interior accents in the Audi RS6 Avant performance",
            "In the interior, the familiar RS design packages in gray and red have been expanded to include blue.

            "Driver assistance systems",
            "Audi offers more than 30 driver assistance systems in the RS6 Avant and RS6 Avant performance, each of which makes driving even more comfortable, efficient, and safe. Some of the systems are bundled into the City and Tour packages.",
            "The adaptive cruise assist (ACA) is the most important system in the Tour assist package. It adds a lane-tracking function that also helps out in traffic jams to the adaptive cruise control (ACC). At speeds between 0 and 250 km/h (155.3 mph), the system keeps the Audi RS6 Avant and the RS6 Avant performance at the desired distance to the vehicle ahead. It also makes slight steering corrections to help the driver to stay in the lane.",
            "Another highlight is the emergency assist, which provides for greater safety. It detects when the driver is inactive and provides a visual, acoustic, or haptic warning depending on the hazard. If this does not prompt a reaction, the system takes control of the RS6 Avant and the RS6 Avant performance and automatically stops it in its own lane with the hazard warning lights on. This also activates pre sense safety measures and, depending on the country, triggers an automatic emergency call.",
            "With the City package, five systems assist the driver: The crossing assist warns of critical cross traffic in front of the car, and Audi pre sense 360° warns of vehicles approaching from the side. The rear cross traffic assist detects approaching vehicles when slowly driving backwards, for example, when pulling out of a parking spot perpendicular to the road. Exit warning and lane change warning supplement the package.",
            "The Audi pre sense basic and Audi pre sense front safety systems come standard. The Audi pre sense rear system can be added as an option. They detect collision hazards all around the car and initiate targeted preventive measures - whether maximum braking, adjusting the seats, or tightening the belts. Audi pre sense front includes a warning and braking function for vehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists.",
            "Behind the assistance systems in the RS6 Avant and RS6 Avant performance are the central driver assistance controller (zFAS) and a portfolio of sensors that complement each other with their respective strengths. The data from the various sensors flow together in the zFAS. With its high-end processors, the tablet-sized computer continually computes a differentiated image of the vehicle's surroundings. This centralized environment model enables the assistance systems to further improve their performance compared to the predecessor model, for example, when they detect the end of a traffic jam and initiate braking. Also, navigation is even more precise, because the computer uses the sensor data fusion to locate your own car down to the exact lane."

The potent 4.0-litre V8 biturbo TFSI engine now has an output of 630PS and a maximum torque of 850Nm.",
            "At Audi, 'performance' means more power. For example, larger turbochargers and an increase in boost pressure from 2.4 to 2.6 bar in the 4.0-litre V8 biturbo TFSI engine that both the Audi RS6 Avant performance and RS7 Sportback performance boast, allow an increase of 30PS in engine power and 50Nm more torque compared to the outgoing versions. This means a total increase in power from 600PS to 630PS and in maximum torque from 800Nm to 850Nm. The performance models sprint from 0-62mph in 3.4 seconds, 0.2 seconds faster than the outgoing RS6 / RS7 base versions.",
            "Yet less is sometimes more: reduced insulation between the engine compartment, the interior, and the rear of the vehicle ensures the performance duo will thrill customers with an exciting, next-level sound experience - the reduction also makes the car eight kilograms lighter. The Audi RS6 Avant performance has a total unladen weight of 2,090kg whilst the RS7 Sportback performance weighs 2,065 kg.",
            "Performance as standard in the UK",
            "The RS6 Avant performance and RS7 Sportback performance now become the standard offering in their respective model lines in the UK, replacing the current base versions.",
            "As a result, there has been an uplift in the level of standard equipment across the range over the current offering. The entry performance models now benefit from a Bang & Olufsen Premium Sound System with 3D sound, Park Assist Pack with park assist plus, Head-up Display, 360-degree cameras and 22-inch wheels in matt grey. Visually, the exterior style package in matt grey is also now standard, while the RS sport exhaust comes finished in gloss black, along with the Audi rings and badges. The RS design package in either red, blue or grey is now standard along with an Alcantara flat bottom steering wheel. Top speed limit increases to 174mph.",

Performance Carbon Black and performance Carbon Vorsprung editions come as standard with 22-inch lightweight wheels finished in matt black. Inspired by motorsport, the airy 5-Y spoke design aids brake cooling and the lighter rims are manufactured in a high-tech forging-milling process. The new lightweight wheel is around five kilograms lighter than the 22-inch aluminium wheel on the current RS6 Avant or RS7 Sportback - this 20kg weight reduction in unsprung masses improves the throttle response.",
            "New high-performance Continental \"Sport Contact 7\" 285/30 tyres, which are part of the new lightweight wheel, play a key role in reducing weight. The tyres offer consistently better grip on both dry and wet roads and reduce understeering when cornering at speed, making for overall more precise handling across the entire speed range. Additionally, the braking distance is up to two meters shorter with the new wheels when braking from 62-0mph.",

For example, the coasting mode now only activates automatically in the efficiency profile, which means in speed ranges up to 99mph, it switches off the combustion engine and coasts with no fuel consumption or drag torque from the engine. Additionally, fine-tuning to the engine control unit software makes for tighter load changes in S mode when the \"dynamic\" drive select mode or driving mode S is active. The updated software in the transmission control unit makes for faster shifting times and a noticeably increased spread between the various driving modes.",
            "RS Dynamic Package as standard",

The seat belts are full-surface ocean blue with decorative inlays in a carbon twill structure with optional blue accents. The selector lever knob and the side of the centre console are made with Dinamica microfiber, which consists of around 45 percent recycled PET fibres and the sports seats feature high-quality Valcona leather upholstery perforated with honeycomb stitching with contrasting stitching in Mercato blue. Another distinguishing feature is an entrance LED in the front doors that projects the lettering \"RS performance\" onto the ground next to the car.",
            "On Carbon Black specification and above, customers benefit from RS design packages in the three available colour variants with optional additional features: door armrests and a centre armrest in Dinamica microfiber. An added benefit of this equipment variant is the seat centre panel with a grey, red, or blue inlay, whilst the customer's chosen colour shows through the perforated sports seats and the seat backs feature RS embossing in matching colours.",
            "The displays of the standard 12.3-inch Audi virtual cockpit plus offer new features including a blinking shift indicator in manual transmission mode which changes the rpm display from green to yellow to red, blinking in a manner identical to that used in motorsport, to indicate the optimal time to change gears.

            "The RS6 Avant performance and RS7 Sportback performance in the C8 generation continue Audi's long-standing sport strategy of plus and performance models. It all began with the RS6 Avant Plus in the C5 generation, shortly before the series was discontinued in 2004, quattro GmbH (now Audi Sport GmbH) launched a special limited series of 999 units with a subtle upgrade in power. The engine power climbed by 30PS to 480PS and the model bore the distinction of being the first Audi to officially go faster than 155mph fastest sport wagon. Without the engine control unit, it reached a top speed of more than 186mph.",
            "The plus variant in the C6 generation hit the market in 2008 and was limited to 500 units. Unlike its predecessor, it did not feature any additional power; the V10 kept its 580PS. But Audi limited the top speed of the special Avant and Sedan to 188mph; the only faster vehicle at the time was the R8.",
            "In the C7 generation, \"plus\" became \"performance\" - the Audi RS6 Avant and RS7 Sportback performance rolled off the line in 2016, with a slightly tweaked engine, the power rose to 605PS, 45PS more than in the base model. The overboost function increased briefly to 750Nm in \"dynamic\" driving mode and depending on equipment, the speed was limited at 155, 174 or 189mph."

It has been named France's favourite car, become an international bestseller and won two Car of the Year awards in Europe. It has been one of the most emblematic city cars in the market for five generations. And it has now reinvented itself, becoming a perfect illustration of the Renault brand's \"Nouvelle Vague\" brimming with its latest breakthroughs. Its new style is even more compelling and elegant, and its chic and distinguished interior is ushering in a new cycle with the first rendering of the brand's new design language. The new technical front radiates vigour, the light signature has been completely revamped and channels the brand's identity, and the new taut, exact and efficient lines give this New Clio a more striking character and make it a vibrant status symbol with a more emotional feel. New Clio has also updated its technology, for instance including a digital dashboard in all its trims.

            "A NEW, MORE MODERN, MORE ASSERTIVE STYLE",
            "New Clio was crafted to mirror the Renault brand's new human-centric and tech-centric design. The new Renault logo at the centre of the completely redesigned front face adds expression. This revamp captures the brand's aim to build more modern, more distinctive and more sustainable cars for life and living grounded in its time-honoured values. The new signature lighting - which will reach all Renault vehicles in future - blends into this new style and conveys two of its hallmarks: precision and character. The universe inside has been reinvented: the new upholstery and new bio-sourced materials make it an up-to-the-minute vehicle and significantly enhance its quality and the experience on board. The Esprit Alpine trim is sporty and classy inside and out, and is the version that best encapsulates New Clio's new era.",
            "A status-symbol front",
            "New Renault Clio's front face has been completely redesigned: its sculpted, tauter and groovier contour adds a modern vibe and verve. The enlarged chequered grille adds strength and a sporty feel. The colour scale - darker near the logo, lighter towards the edges - gives it depth and a technical edge. This universe of effects has radically overhauled New Clio's design, adding allure.",
            "A distinctive logo",
            "The brushed-satin chrome Nouvel'R logo at the front honours the brand's heritage. Its geometry is simple, meaningful, and as a result timeless. The symbiosis between the two diamonds, and the optical effect interlocking them, adds a sense of complementarity and continuous motion. This logo conveys New Clio's identity more categorically than ever.",
            "A chiselled aerodynamic blade",
            "The Techno and Esprit Alpine trims come with an airfoil directly inspired by the motorsports universe beneath the grille.

            "New Clio is the first vehicle in Renault's \"Nouvelle Vague\" to feature the new signature lighting at the front. It is inspired by the logo: the LED daytime running lights on either side, for instance, each form one half of an upright rhombus, underscoring the face's pulsating, sparkling mien and making the line-up's design more consistent with the brand's image.",
            "The slender full-LED headlamps, included in all the trims, point to precision and technical savvy, and sharpen the car's look.

As soon as you open the door, you see the nobler and more sustainable materials and feel the quality leap. Spaciousness and ergonomics are still the vehicle's key strengths, treating everyone inside to unrivalled comfort. All the technology is there to enhance the user experience and blends into a universe of connected services and applications that help the driver and passengers relax and enjoy the journey.",

            "New Renault Clio's Techno trim seats, door panels and dashboard are clad in a specially developed sustainable fabric that comprises of up to 60% TENCEL branded modal fibres, a bio-based cellulosic fibre manufactured by the Lenzing Group. Contributing to the Renault brand's decarbonization strategy, the New Clio is not only the first car that features TENCEL Modal fibres. It is also the first time these sustainable fibres are used extensively inside a vehicle. Renowned for exceptional softness, the fibres are made from a renewable resource - natural wood that are sourced from sustainably managed semi-natural forests in Europe. These semi-natural forests absorb large amounts of CO2 and do not require any chemical fertilizers nor artificial irrigation. TENCEL Modal fibres are produced using renewable energy and have been certified with the EU Ecolabel, an environmental excellence label that is awarded to products and services meeting high environmental standards throughout their life cycle.",

            "An upgraded and updated dashboard",
            "New Renault Clio's new dashboard includes an edgeless digital display, spanning 7 to 10 inches diagonally according to the trim.

            "Sporty outside",
            "The grille at the front underscores New Clio's sporty edge and assertive design. It is hot-stamped and ranges from dark at the centre to glossy chrome by the edges, adding depth and power to the car. A Glossy Black line cuts across it horizontally and stretches to the headlights. The logo has also been recast and its exclusive Ice Black brushed aluminium finish now accentuates the vehicle's technical edge. A specific Esprit Alpine badge has been added to the front wing.",
            "The Matte Shale Grey blade at the front conjures up racing cars and the motor-sports universe that this model symbolises. The rocker panels and rear bumper diffusers are the same tone. These aerodynamic scoops on the bumper visually enlarge the rear to give it a sportier look.",
            "The Esprit Alpine trim also comes with 17 inch aluminium wheels that radiate Alpine DNA: they are diamond-cut, black with smoky grey varnish, around blue or grey centres (depending on the body colour), pumping up the car's dynamic, refined and technical feel. The Clio badge at the back is Deep Glossy Black.",
            "Elegant inside",
            "The interior design is also specific to this trim - and its sportiness and elegance are in a class by themselves. The seat shapes are more enveloping to provide more lateral support and added comfort. The materials are exclusive, and lighter grey in the middle of the seat and back to underline the sporty vibe. The sides are covered in a thicker material. There are specific technical features in all the details, including a Y-shaped pattern over the seats, and is reminiscent of athletes' sports shirts. Blue overstitching and the Alpine brand's letter A heat-welded onto the back of the seat complete this sporty version. A red, white and blue flag, symbolising France, is stitched onto the side.",
            "The Esprit Alpine trim's seats are also made of sustainable materials, including a fabric that is 72% recycled PET (polyethylene) on the seat and back and a 13% recycled grained coated textile on the seat sides.",
            "Other details and enhancements complete this trim's interior. The steering wheel, for instance, was designed especially to capture the Alpine spirit: the red, white and blue double overstitching, perforated material and Deep Glossy Black background for the Ice Black logo in the centre entice you to start the engine. The dashboard also features an embroidered French flag, the seatbelts at the front and back have distinctive blue edges (except the one in the middle), the pedals are aluminium and the front door sills are exclusive to the trim.",
            "When you sit in the driver's seat, the Renault Easy Link screen lights up and displays a welcome message with a sequence featuring the Alpine brand's hallmarks.",

            "New Renault Clio treats everyone inside it to even more convenience with streamlined, quality-enhancing technologies for the driver as well as the passengers. Its Renault Easy Link multimedia system, combined with the MULTI-SENSE settings and twenty available driver assistance systems add up to an eminently intuitive experience in a car made for life and living.",
            "Digital displays across the range",
            "The new services and top-of-the-line connectivity make New Clio even more intuitive for users. All the trims come with a 7 inch or 10 inch digital dashboard. The 10 inch one replicates navigation maps and adapts to the driving mode and MULTI-SENSE setting.",
            "Wireless smartphone connection",
            "New Clio feature Renault Easy Link, a multimedia gateway to a full array of applications including navigation, proactive maintenance and infotainment.",

            "The automatic air conditioning, hands-free card key and wireless smartphone charger are only three of the many amenities that make driving and travelling in New Clio more versatile and enjoyable than ever. The others include a height-adjustable passenger seat in the front and a central armrest starting with the Techno version. All this while offering rear passenger space in terms of accessibility and knee radius and a boot holding up to 391 litres* that ranks New Clio among the best in its class.",
            "New Renault Clio's MULTI-SENSE technology opens the door to explore a new world of experiences by adjusting lighting settings on the dashboard and centre console. It is high-tech, fine-tuneable, classy, and treats everyone to a fantastic in-car experience.",

The wheelbase has grown minimally, to 2,770 millimetres, and the ground clearance to 190 millimetres. At 2,050 millimetres the Roadiaq is more than 35 centimetres taller than the standard version, mainly due to the new roof section. A part of the original roof had to be removed in order to provide significantly more headroom. Thus digital nomads can enjoy even more space for working and relaxing. A tent attachment provides shelter in bad weather and enables more comfortable use of the kitchen installed in the rear of the vehicle. The reworked rear left door, with its handle removed, offers more privacy in the sleeping area thanks to its window featuring that features a sun blind. Additionally, solar cells help generate energy for the living compartment, ensuring the vehicle maintains range while off grid. The Roadiaq can also be connected to an external power supply at campsites or motorhome parks.",
            "Multifunctional interior with fabrics made from sustainable materials",
            "Extensive modifications to the entire interior behind the front seats have created a space that can be used for work and also converts to a one-person bedroom in a few simple steps. The interior mirrors the Roadiaq's exterior colours and uses fabrics made from 100% recycled materials. The complete upholstery for the seats, door trims, instrument panel and roof pillars was produced in collaboration with the external upholstery experts from Autointerier Šindelář, a company that has cooperated with the Student Car project for many years. The fabrics made from recycled textiles come from the specialists at Dual Borgstena, who already work with Škoda on series production projects. The mono-material concept ensures complete recyclability of the fabric at the end of the vehicle's lifecycle. Cushion covers and a blanket were made using a special 3D knit technology, a waste-free process that uses recycled material for the covers.",
            "Support from camper van conversion experts",
            "The project traditionally benefits from close cooperation between specialists from all Škoda departments. Yet, when fitting the vehicle with the custom-made roof structure and furniture, the apprentices also called upon external experts for help. The companies Cargodesign and KPS Automobile were brought in to advise the students and actively assisted with the construction of both exterior and interior fittings. In addition to the camping and office equipment in the rear of the vehicle, the apprentices also created a passenger-seat workstation. A special arm offers the passenger a place to attach their tablet. The interior is rounded off by numerous equipment features and accessories for entertainment and relaxation, some of which are already part of Škoda's range. They include a wireless speaker, a solar-powered shower, an espresso machine with a 12 V connection, kitchen appliances, chairs, tables, plates, pots and pans, cups and glasses, USB and charging cables, carpets and trims as well as torches and a survival kit for the adventurous travellers.",

The range simulator of the new GLC Coupé takes into account such external factors as ambient temperature, driving profile and heating or cooling requirements. This clarifies under what conditions the actual electric range may differ from the certified figure.",
            "A noticeably more electric driving experience",
            "The high power density of the hybrid drive unit comes courtesy of a permanently excited internal rotor synchronous motor. The peak torque of the electric motor is ready to go right from the start, resulting in high agility when moving off, along with dynamic driving performance. The full electric power is available up to 140 km/h. In the new GLC Coupé, Mercedes-Benz uses an electromechanical brake booster. It automatically controls the flexible transition between hydraulic braking and recuperation depending on the driving situation to ensure optimal energy recovery and braking performance at all times. As a result, the maximum recuperation power of up to 100 kW is achieved more frequently.",
            "The high-voltage battery is an in-house development by Mercedes-Benz. It has an installed capacity of 31.2 kWh. Starting from empty, a full recharge with the optional 60 kW DC charger is completed in around 30 minutes. The GLC Coupé is equipped as standard with an 11 kW three-phase AC charger.",
            "Suspension: Agility and safety",
            "The dynamically designed suspension system of the new Mercedes-Benz GLC Coupé is based on a new four-link front suspension and a multi-link independent rear suspension mounted to a subframe. The hybrids have air suspension and level control at the rear axle as standard. All other variants are equipped with a sport suspension. The variable steering ratio is also standard across the board. On request the new GLC Coupé is available with the Tech Package. This includes the AIRMATIC air suspension system and active rear-axle steering with a 4.5° steering angle. AIRMATIC provides continuously adjustable damping for the compression and rebound stages of the shock absorbers.",
            "The new GLC Coupé is especially agile and stable with the optional rear-axle (included with the Tech package). At speeds below 60 km/h, the rear wheels steer in the opposite direction to the front wheels - and by up to 4.5° when parking. The wheelbase then feels shorter, making the vehicle more manoeuvrable and agile, and the turning circle is reduced by 90 cm to 10.9 metres. When the speed reaches 60 km/h or more, the rear wheels steer in the same direction as the front wheels by up to 4.5°. The virtually extended wheelbase has noticeable advantages in the form of improved handling stability and safety at high speeds, during fast lane-changes or sudden evasive manoeuvres. In addition, during dynamic manoeuvres the vehicle is more responsive to steering commands. The rear axle steering is combined with a more direct steering ratio at the front axle so that the number of steering wheel turns from lock to lock is reduced.",
            "Assistance systems: Comfort and safety",
            "The latest generation of the Driving Assistance Plus package contains additional and improved functions. These reduce driver workload in day-to-day situations for more comfortable and safer driving. When danger threatens, the systems are able to respond to impending collisions as the situation demands. For example, the DISTRONIC active distance assist can maintain a pre-set distance to vehicles ahead on all road types: on motorways, country roads or in town. The current speed limit can be selected as the speed setting at the push of a button. The active brake assist uses the sensors installed in the vehicle to detect imminent collisions with crossing or oncoming traffic or rear-end collisions. In case of danger, the system can issue an acoustic and visual alert. If the driver fails to brake hard enough, it can also assist by appropriately increasing the braking force or initiating an emergency stop. One of the new features of Active Steering Assist is lane detection with an additional 360-degree camera, which offers advantages especially at low speeds, for example when forming an emergency lane. The stop sign and red traffic light warning functions of the Traffic Sign Assistant are new.",
            "Sophisticated parking systems for support with slow manoeuvres",
            "Thanks to more powerful environment sensors, the parking systems can better support drivers when manoeuvring. The integration of the sensors into MBUX makes operation more intuitive and provides support through the visual display. Optional rear-axle steering is integrated into the parking assistant and paths are calculated accordingly. Emergency braking functions also serve to protect other road users for improved road safety.",
            "The new Parking package with 360° camera is available as an optional extra. It also includes the \"transparent bonnet\" and the active parking assist functions with PARKTRONIC. The all-round visibility and parking assistance make it easier to manoeuvre: The central display clearly shows the immediate surroundings. Four cameras (front, rear, both sides) provide the images, which are combined in a virtual 360° bird's-eye view. In addition, the display shows different viewing angles such as front, rear or trailer mode. Drivers decide whether to use the displays to park themselves or to let the parking assistant take control. The Memory Parking Assistant is available as an operational extra: It remembers parking locations such as how to get into and out of the garage at home. After the training process is completed, the system lets the driver at the wheel choose whether to carry out the automatic parking process. If obstacles are detected, the system stops until they are removed.",
            "DIGITAL LIGHT: extremely bright with optional projection functions",
            "The new Mercedes-Benz GLC Coupé has LED High Performance headlamps as standard. DIGITAL LIGHT is available as an optional extra. The light is created by a matrix of LEDs in the headlight unit that can be individually controlled. This permits a targeted and dynamic distribution and control of light in response to conditions. The result is excellent visibility for the driver without impairing that of other road users. DIGITAL LIGHT with projection function is available as an option. This offers extra safety for the driver and allows communication with other road users. For example, it can make driving safer by projecting guiding lines, symbols and animations. The intelligent technology highlights pedestrians in the danger zone with a spotlight function and clarifies their position with projected direction points. A warning symbol appears when drivers go the wrong way on motorway entry ramps or one-way streets. The same symbol appears before the vehicle runs a red light or stop sign.",
            "Over hill and dale: Off-road with the GLC Coupé",
            "As before, the new Mercedes-Benz GLC Coupé is also suitable for off-road driving and has several new features and systems designed for that use. Standard equipment includes an off-road driving mode and DSR (Downhill Speed Regulation). The plug-in models offer all-electric off-road driving. With electric motor's full torque of 440 Nm available from the very first turn of the engine, its power is easy to control at all times. This allows highly precise, controlled driving even in challenging terrain. In addition, because the electric motor only consumes energy when it is actually moving the vehicle, power demand will be low at normal off-road speeds. As a result, a long all-electric driving time is possible even on demanding terrain.",
            "In off-road mode, the GLC Coupé with the 360° camera offers a \"transparent bonnet\". The central display shows a virtual view under the front of the vehicle, including the front wheels and their steering position. This enables the driver to recognise obstacles such as large stones or deep potholes sooner and more easily.",
            "The off-road screen mode uses the two displays for clear presentation of information, controls and key functions for off-road conditions. Among other things, the driver's display shows inclination, gradient, topographical altitude, geo-coordinates and a compass as well as road speed and engine speed when operating with an internal combustion engine. The central display shows the current position on the terrain as well as the steering angle of the front wheels. If the vehicle has rear-wheel steering it also shows the steering direction of the rear wheels. All the driving functions relevant for off-road operation can be controlled easily on one screen.",
            "The Technology package (optional) with AIRMATIC air suspension including level control and rear-axle steering also brings its comfort advantages to bear when off-road, where it offers additional benefits. For example, AIRMATIC allows a high ground clearance off-road, regardless of the load, and long suspension travel for the best possible traction. The rear-axle steering increases off-road manoeuvrability even further.",
            "New with the GLC Coupé: Trailer menu and towing route planner for navigation: In the central display, routes can be planned that are suitable for driving with the previously defined trailer. This takes into account permitted widths and heights along the route, among other aspects. As soon as the ballhead is engaged and the electrical connection is made, the towing route planner prompts the driver for input via MBUX. Is a small trailer attached to the vehicle? Or a larger one such as a caravan or horse box? Or a bicycle carrier? The aim of these and other innovations and functions for operation as a towing vehicle is to make towing as safe and pleasant as possible. The 4MATIC all-wheel drive provides outstanding traction on any surface. When towing a trailer, the ESP® stabilisation program is activated. It can compensate for dynamic imbalances while driving.",
            "The enhanced Trailer Manoeuvring Assist (optional) in the new GLC Coupé makes manoeuvring with a trailer easier, safer and more comfortable. The system automatically regulates the steering angle of the towing vehicle up to a speed of 5 km/h and an uphill gradient of up to 15 percent. It is also integrated into MBUX and can be operated intuitively. In addition to stabilising the combination when reversing, for the first time the system can also guide it around driver-defined bends of up to 90°. It automatically steers the towing vehicle and maintains the selected angle. This allows more precise positioning of the trailer. The driver can also select the \"pull straight\" function when the trailer has reached the desired direction and is to reverse straight. The entire manoeuvring process can be followed from different camera perspectives on the central display. Dynamic lines show the trajectory and the vehicle width.",
            "High level of passive safety",
            "Whether in right- or left-hand drive, with petrol engine, diesel engine or as a plug-in hybrid: when it comes to crash safety, all models meet the stringent Mercedes safety standards.",
            "Together with the familiar PRE-SAFE® protection concepts for frontal and rear impacts, the PRE-SAFE® Impulse Side function forms a virtual crumple zone around the vehicle. It is optionally available with Driver Assistance Package Plus. As only a limited crumple zone is available in the case of a side impact, it pushes the affected driver or front-seat passenger towards the middle of the vehicle and away from the acute danger zone when the system detects an imminent side collision. To do this, the system inflates air chambers in the side bolsters of the front-seat backrests in a fraction of a second.",
            "All in all, the safety concept of the Mercedes-Benz GLC Coupé is based on an intelligently designed body with a particularly rigid passenger cell, selectively deformable crash structures and situational interaction between the seat belts, belt tensioners and airbag systems. In addition to legal requirements, the vehicle also fulfils internal Mercedes-Benz test requirements and test criteria derived from real accidents.",
            "The occupants are particularly well protected by the vehicle structure in the event of a crash. The bodyshell concept incorporates all areas - front structure, passenger cell, side walls and floor assembly. All structural elements and body parts are designed to withstand stresses through the material mix and appropriate wall thicknesses. The overall concept leads to homogeneous load distributions and high energy absorption with moderate deceleration acting on the occupants. In addition, sufficient protective space is provided for them."

            "The latest model to be built around Honda's acclaimed e:HEV hybrid technology, the Honda ZR-V features an upgraded version of the twin electric motor system. As found in the Civic e:HEV, the powertrain now produces a total power output of 135 kW and 315 Nm of torque, providing acceleration from a standstill to 62 mph / 100 km/h from just 7.8 seconds.",
            "Despite the strong performance, the ZR-V also offers genuine real-world efficiency, where the updated e:HEV produces CO2 emissions from 130 g/km (WLTP) and achieves fuel economy from just 5.7 L/100km (WLTP combined).",
            "The full-hybrid powertrain combines a power-dense lithium-ion battery and two compact, powerful electric motors with a newly developed 2.0-litre direct-injection Atkinson-cycle petrol engine, shifting without notice between EV, Hybrid and Engine Drive with no input from the driver.",
            "When driving in an urban environment the vehicle mostly runs in EV Drive, producing zero emissions whilst utilising the seamless and responsive traits of electric driving. When the driver requires stronger acceleration, the car will switch to Hybrid Drive to propel the wheels via the powerful electric motor, with the internal combustion engine generating the required electric power.",
            "At constant high speeds, such as on the motorway, the system will shift to Engine Drive, and is directly and efficiently powered by the petrol engine with minimum losses and assisted by the electric motor when necessary. When the required drive energy increases towards top speed, the system switches back to Hybrid Drive to unleash the full output of the electric motor.",
            "In all drive modes, brake and deceleration energy is recuperated to improve the overall efficiency, resulting in remarkably low fuel consumption - particularly in stop and go traffic. Thanks to the high rigidity of the crankshaft and the secondary balancer shaft, the engine has lower vibrations over the entire speed range than in previous generations of the e:HEV system, enabling a smooth drive in every mode.",
            "The evolution of Honda's hybrid technology over 20 years has resulted in a sophisticated yet compact and efficient power unit that combines the responsiveness and power of an electric motor with the long-range refinement of a petrol engine to impress in both urban and rural driving. It not only provides instant response when accelerating at low speeds but also at high speeds on the motorway.",
            "Linear shift control correlates engine sound to engine acceleration G for a more reassuring acceleration feel, which is a major evolution from Honda's previous hybrid vehicles.",
            "Using a drive selector, users can seamlessly switch between four drive modes: 'Normal', 'Sport', 'Eco' and 'Snow'. Sport mode sharpens throttle response and improves performance, while Eco adjusts throttle response to improve fuel efficiency. The new Snow mode tailors throttle response characteristics to suit driving on low friction surfaces to reduce the burden on drivers in difficult conditions.",
            "Refined engine offers class-leading thermal efficiency and emissions levels",
            "Direct injection technology enables the fuel to be injected into the engine multiple times during a simple combustion phase, known as a multistage injection, which reduces emissions over a wide operating range. Optimised for faster and more efficient combustion and greater torque, the newly refined engine structure and combustion concept also helps the new Honda ZR-V to cope with a higher compression ratio, thanks to improved exhaust port cooling performance and together with the Atkinson combustion cycle achieves an industry leading thermal efficiency of 41%.",
            "Honda engineers developed the new engine to meet future emissions limits, using a low temperature activating catalyst, optimised intake port shapes for high tumble air flow and sodium filled valves, all of which help to improve both emissions and fuel economy.",
            "The latest iteration of Honda's Intelligent Power Unit (IPU) is positioned beneath the rear cargo area to optimize the overall vehicle packaging thanks to its compact dimensions and reduced weight. A new Power Control Unit (PCU), located under the bonnet to save space, controls the high voltage electric power of the hybrid system.",
            "The increase in power density of the PCU and energy density of the IPU allows the electric motor to take more of the load in a greater range of driving scenarios. In turn, this enables the engine to run at a lower operating speed, reducing fuel consumption and allowing greater levels of torque at higher speeds.",
            "Responsive handling and a refined ride for outstanding driveability",
            "The all-new Honda ZR-V inspires confidence behind the wheel, delivering impressive levels of grip and control in all driving situations and road conditions, from urban areas where responsive acceleration is required, to fast winding country routes where vehicle stability is key.

            "The frame of the ZR-V is central to both the assured style and stance of the car, as well as the dynamic behaviour. Sitting 59mm lower than the CR-V (on 18\" tyres) and 50mm wider than the HR-V, the low and wide appearance gives an impressive footprint and solid base on which to build a dynamic SUV.",
            "At the front is a MacPherson strut arrangement mounted to a lightweight aluminium front subframe with an efficient truss and rib structure that provides rigidity and stability.",
            "A tempering process heat treats the lower ball joints on the front suspension to reduce the surface pressure between the ball and resin ball seat. Additional friction-reducing measures include the use of a low-friction seat for the front damper mount bearings and optimizing the axes of the springs and dampers.",
            "Multilink rear suspension and a floating subframe work together to deliver predictable and confidence-inspiring steering, while the lightweight subframe and optimised bushes deliver premium NVH management. Combined with a steering system that features a dual-pinion assist electric power steering (EPS) with feedback control, and low-friction ball joints in the chassis set up, steering is effortless but with exceptional feedback, boosting driver confidence and comfort at any speed. Strategic use of ultra-high-tensile materials and structural adhesive offer additional levels of chassis rigidity to help deliver assured handling when cornering at speed, by significantly reducing body roll.",
            "Dual-pinion assist electronic power steering (EPS) which features a honed steering column bearing to reduce steering friction and improve steering feel. In addition, the EPS has been tuned to provide excellent feedback and improved straight-line stability. A non-contact torque sensor measures the driver's steering effort, and an ECU determines how much electric motor assist to add, with the result being a seamless, natural steering feel.",
            "Feedback control also was added to the EPS, enabling more precise control when unwinding the steering to return to a straight line. This results in smooth steering feel with strong resistance to ride disturbances, and excellent straight-line stability for driver peace of mind.",

            "The Collision Mitigation Braking System, which helps bring the car to a stop if the system determines that a collision with a vehicle detected in front is unavoidable. A warning sound, and if necessary, brake pressure is automatically applied.",
            "The Road Departure Mitigation System is the default safety system within the ZR-V. The always active system alerts drivers when lane drift is detected without a turn signal in use. This is complimented by Honda's Lane Keep Assist System, which reduces the driver burden whilst behind the wheel and ensures the vehicle maintains proper position by gently applying steering inputs to ensure the Honda ZR-V doesn't depart from its identified detected lane.",
            "Honda's latest Traffic Jam Assist technology is also available, reducing the driver's workload in low speed congested traffic by helping to keep the vehicle in its lane from 0 km/h. When traffic congestion clears, the car seamlessly switches to the Lane Keeping Assist System from 72 km/h - a lower speed than conventional systems.",
            "The recently updated Traffic Sign Recognition System now detects and automatically recognises over 90% of road signs and displays them on the instrument binnacle behind the steering wheel. For example, the system can quickly notify the driver when they are approaching or passing a specific road sign, such as speed limits or any restrictions. The system also provides a pre-notification of signs to inform the driver as soon as possible and help them prepare sooner for junctions.",
            "Adaptive Driving Beam automatically switches from high beam to low beam when an oncoming vehicle, or a vehicle in front, is detected, for the safety of both drivers. The Auto High-Beam Headlights are activated through the front sensor, which automatically switches the headlights when driving at night or in poor conditions such as fog.",
            "The Driver Attention Monitor feature helps drivers recognise when their attention to the road is becoming diminished, enhancing their awareness on long journeys. The system uses an angle sensor to measure the degree of steering-wheel corrections by the driver to maintain a proper lane position. If it senses unusual and constant correction activity, the system will notify the driver to take a break.

            "As functional as its predecessor, as intelligent and customisable as never before: The new Mercedes-Benz E-Class Estate, model series 214, impresses in many areas. The design has also changed: The roofline is more dynamically designed compared to its predecessor, and at the same time the new E-Class Estate scores again with functionality and load compartment volume. Combined with the raked rear window, the overall appearance is progressive.",
            "Like the Saloon before it, the Estate not only continues the long model history of the classic E-Class, but also bridges the gap to the avant-garde trendsetters from Mercedes-EQ with its new design. Balanced proportions are part of the appearance of a classic estate car. They are defined by the short front overhang, the long bonnet with powerdomes, the longer wheelbase and the balanced rear overhang.",
            "With its distinctive side profile, the Estate clearly sets itself apart from the competition. The two character lines familiar from the Saloon create a powerfully stretched car body and give the Estate a sporty and stylish appearance. Sophisticated, three-dimensional and optimised down to the last detail, the surface finish exudes elegance.",
            "A black panel-like surface connects the radiator grille with the headlamps. This insert in high-gloss black is visually reminiscent of the Mercedes-EQ models. The three-dimensionally designed radiator grille is either progressive or classic, depending on the equipment line. A chrome-framed radiator grille backlit by optical fibres is optionally available for all lines (Avantgarde, Exclusive and AMG Line). The new E-Class Estate features LED High Performance headlamps as standard. As an optional extra, DIGITAL LIGHT is available without and with a projection function. All headlamp variants offer a distinctive day and night design. As a typical feature of the brand, the daytime running lights take the shape of an eyebrow.",
            "Precisely designed chrome elements as well as the progressively styled, two-part rear lamps characterise the rear-end design. Thanks to its large opening, the load compartment can be used in a variety of ways. The design team has reinterpreted the rear lamps in terms of their contours and inner workings. With great depth of detail and partly animated functions, the interior design contributes to the vehicle's high value appeal. The unique star motif makes the day and night design of the rear lamps unmistakable. The two light sections in the side wall and boot lid are visually connected. This further emphasises the width of the rear. The reflectors have been relocated to the bumper. Because this allowed the load compartment opening to be particularly large, this increases the utility value on the one hand and makes the rear view look even wider on the other.",
            "Even more spacious in the rear and the familiar high utility value",
            "Compared to its predecessor, the Mercedes-Benz E-Class Estate has increased in width by 28 millimetres. This gives the rear passengers even more space: The elbow room in the rear is 1519 millimetres - 25 millimetres more than before. The wheelbase has increased by 22 millimetres to 2961 millimetres. As a result, rear-seat passengers enjoy more knee room (84 millimetres; plus 9 millimetres) and leg room (934 millimetres; plus 15 millimetres). The load compartment can be expanded from 615 litres to up to 1830 litres. In the plug-in hybrid model, the luggage capacity is 460-1675 litres, and the load compartment is level there, too.",
            "The seat backrests can be split and folded down in a 40:20:40 ratio. Operation is by two push buttons on the left and right side of the rear seat backrest. The Estate model features the EASY-PACK tailgate as standard. The tailgate opens and closes conveniently at the touch of a button: using the button on the ignition key, the switch in the driver's door or the release handle on the tailgate. The retractable luggage cover and dividing net (both standard) have a two-piece design. Each has its own roller cassette.",
            "MBUX Superscreen as a highlight of the interior design",
            "The dashboard makes for the digital experience in the interior. If the E-Class Estate is equipped with the optional front passenger screen, the large glass surface of the MBUX Superscreen extends to the central display. Visually detached from this is the driver's display in the driver's field of vision. The models without a passenger display feature a large trim element that extends to the centre. Visually detached, the central display appears to float above the concave surface of this trim element.",
            "The front section of the instrument panel is illuminated by the light strip of the Active Ambient Lighting. This runs in a wide arc from the windscreen, past the A-pillars and into the doors. This creates a generous feeling of space. An apparently free-floating control array in the upper section of the door panels matches the look of the glass surfaces of the screens.",
            "The centre console is designed as a homogeneous unit and merges in a straight line into the lower section of the dashboard. At the front, a stowage compartment with lid and cup holders is integrated into the three-dimensionally shaped trim element. There is a soft padded armrest in the rear part of the centre console.",
            "The door centre panel merges seamlessly into the armrest with a concave sweep. The front section here is designed as a metallic high-tech element. It serves as a grab and closing handle, and incorporates the switches for the power windows. Another highlight is the free-floating control array incorporating the door opener and the controls for the seat functions.",
            "The contours of the seat surface and backrest flow elegantly from the inside to the outside, and appear to float above the base of the seat thanks to their layer design. Indented vertical lines follow the outer contour, widening out towards the top.",
            "A plug-in hybrid is already available at launch",
            "Thanks to systematic electrification and intelligent downsizing, the new E-Class sets new standards in efficiency. The combustion engines are four and six-cylinder units from the current modular Mercedes-Benz engine family FAME (Family of Modular Engines). Accordingly, the engine range plays a major role in the flexibility of the international production network, with needs-based electrification.",
            "In addition to turbocharging, both the diesel and petrol engines feature intelligent support from an Integrated Starter-Generator (ISG). They are therefore mild hybrids. Thanks to a new battery, the power of the electric motor has been increased from 15 to 17 kW and the boost torque to 205 Nm. Further mild hybrid models will follow.",
            "With the E300e a plug-in hybrid is also available at market launch already. With an electric output of 95 kW (129 hp) and an all-electric range of up to over 100 kilometres (WLTP), this model will on many days be on the road purely electrically, without the use of the petrol engine. More plug-in hybrids with diesel combustion engines will follow.",
            "Air-sprung rear axle as standard, AIRMATIC available as an option",
            "The agile handling of the new Mercedes-Benz E-Class Estate is due in large part to precise guidance of the front wheels by four control arms each. At the rear axle, an optimised multi-link independent rear suspension with five links ensures excellent wheel control and excellent straight-line stability. At both axles, the springs and dampers are combined in a single strut and are not involved in wheel guidance tasks, therefore the suspension responds with corresponding sensitivity. The front subframe and rear axle carrier decouple the suspension and body from vibrations and noise. As standard, the mild hybrid models are equipped with AGILITY CONTROL steel spring suspension with selective damping system and air-sprung rear axle.",
            "As an option, the new E-Class is available with all-round AIRMATIC air suspension with ADS+ continuously adjustable damping. The AIRMATIC suspension with air springs and adaptive ADS+ dampers responds very sensitively. The all-round level control is another feature of AIRMATIC. It keeps the ground clearance constant irrespective of the vehicle load, but also makes changes when needed.",
            "Impressive, immersive entertainment experience",
            "Music, games and streaming content can be experienced with almost all senses in the E-Class Estate. Thanks to digital innovations in the interior, the E-Class is now more intelligent, achieving a new dimension of personalisation and interaction. At the same time, the electronic architecture is more software-driven and less hardware-driven.",
            "The computing functions of previously separate domains take place in a single processor. Screens and the MBUX infotainment system thus share a new, very powerful central onboard computer. This form of networking improves the performance and speed of the data streams.",
            "The Entertainment Package (MBUX Entertainment Plus) will be available for the new E-Class Estate. It includes Mercedes me connect services and a data package from a third-party provider. Depending on the market, a communication module with 5G as the transmission technology is used. The mobile phone standard 5G makes much faster data rates possible than LTE/UMTS.",
            "The Digital Vehicle Key is now available for the iPhone and Apple Watch",
            "With the Digital Vehicle Key, the Mercedes-Benz E-Class Estate can be started and locked simply by the driver carrying a compatible device with them. Key sharing is also possible: Various digital channels can be used to invite family members or friends to use the E-Class Estate. In doing so, the vehicle owner can assign different rights, granting only access to the vehicle or also allowing it to be driven. The vehicle can recognise several users at once, and the Digital Vehicle Key can be shared by up to 16 persons. In those markets where Mercedes me connect services are available, the pre-installation for the Digital Vehicle Key forms part of the KEYLESS GO Comfort Package. This equipment combination is available in the new E-Class Estate from the Premium Package onwards.",
            "Music becomes visible: Sound Visualisation",
            "With the new Active Ambient Lighting with Sound Visualisation, occupants in the new E-Class Estate can experience music with three senses: pieces of music and sounds from films or apps can be heard (with Dolby Atmos® technology if desired), felt (by means of sound resonating transducers in the optional Burmester® 4D surround sound system) and now also \"seen\". Visualisation takes place on the light strip of the Active Ambient Lighting (optional extra). For the first time, this applies throughout in the E-Class. For example, fast sequences of beats can cause rapid light changes, while flowing rhythms can create softly merging lighting moods.",
            "The entertainment experience for the front passenger is always impressive. On their optional screen, the front passenger can watch dynamic content such as TV or video streaming even when the driver at the wheel is looking over at them. This is because the display is switchable. The advanced camera-based privacy function automatically reduces its brightness and therefore the risk of driver distraction.",
            "New third-party apps plus selfie and video camera",
            "The software experts at Mercedes-Benz have developed a new compatibility layer that allows the installation of third-party apps. The following apps are available on the central display in the E-Class Estate at market launch: the entertainment platform \"TikTok\", the game \"Angry Birds\", the collaborative application \"Webex\" and the office application \"Zoom\" as well as the browser \"Vivaldi\" and the podcast app \"Pocket Casts\". In addition, the ZYNC entertainment portal (optionally) offers video streaming, on-demand content, interactive experiences, local video programmes, sports, news, games and much more on the central and passenger displays, via one user interface.",
            "Another new feature is a selfie and video camera (part of the optional MBUX Superscreen) on top of the dashboard. When the vehicle is stationary, the driver can participate in online video conferences via e.g. \"Webex\", and take personal photos and videos.",
            "More operating convenience is also available with MBUX. With the \"Just Talk\" function, the intelligent voice control can now be activated without the keyword \"Hey Mercedes\". When the function is activated, a red microphone symbol appears in the display. This indicates that the vehicle is ready and waiting for commands.",
            "Added day-to-day convenience: the routines",
            "Mercedes-Benz is working on the use of artificial intelligence (AI) so that the car learns which comfort systems vehicle occupants use repeatedly. Given the same circumstances, the aim is for AI to automate such functions. The result is personalised automation. Mercedes-Benz uses the term 'routine' for this innovation, the development of which is already well advanced.",
            "When the new Mercedes-Benz E-Class Estate is launched, customers will be able to use templates for standard routines. They also have the option of creating routines themselves. In doing so, the occupants can link several functions and conditions. For example, \"Switch on the seat heating and set the ambient lighting to warm orange if the interior temperature is below twelve degrees Celsius\".",
            "For enhanced well-being: ENERGIZING COMFORT and THERMOTRONIC with Digital Vent Control (both optional)",
            "Soothing sounds, mobilising massage, activating light - Mercedes-Benz offers a comprehensive wellness programme with the variously configured ENERGIZING COMFORT programmes and the individual recommendations of the ENERGIZING COACH. The new E-Class generation marks the debut of two innovations: The anti-travel sickness programme of ENERGIZING COMFORT can help affected passengers to alleviate symptoms. A bio-feedback function is planned for the ENERGIZING COACH in the medium term. This can reduce the feeling of stress with breathing exercises.",
            "With THERMOTRONIC automatic climate control (optional extra), Digital Vent Control enhances the comfort experience. It automatically adjusts the front air vents to a desired ventilation scenario. This can be done for each seat via the user profile, for example. However, the nozzles can also be aligned by hand as usual.",
            "Numerous driving assistance systems, some of which have been developed further",
            "The standard equipment of the E-Class Estate with driving assistance systems includes Active Distance Assist DISTRONIC, ATTENTION ASSIST, Active Brake Assist, Active Lane Keeping Assist, Parking Package with reversing camera and Speed Limit Assist. The status and activity of the driving assistance systems are shown as a full-screen view in the Assistance mode of the driver's display.",
            "The Driving Assistance Plus package is also offered as an optional extra, for example as part of the Premium package. Components include Active Steering Assist, which assists with lane-keeping. As already on motorways, the E-Class can now also restart automatically in city traffic and on country roads after a longer standstill. Another new feature: If Active Steering Assist is no longer available because the lane markings are not clearly visible, it signals this to the driver by means of vibration on the steering wheel.",
            "Sophisticated body concept and coordinated restraint systems",
            "The safety concept of the E-Class Estate is based on a body with a particularly rigid passenger cell and specifically deformable crash structures. The restraint systems, e.g. seat belts and airbags, are specifically adapted to this. In the event of an accident, they can be activated in such a way that their protective effect for the occupants is adapted to the situation.",
            "In addition to driver and front passenger airbags, a knee airbag on the driver's side is also standard. It can protect the legs from contact with the steering column or instrument panel in a severe frontal crash. The standard windowbags can reduce the risk of head injuries. In the event of a serious side-on collision, the window airbag on the side of the impact extends from the A- to the C-pillar like a curtain over the front and rear side windows. If a rollover is detected, the window airbags can be activated on both sides. In addition to the head protection system, side airbags can also protect the thorax area in the event of a severe side impact - including on the outer rear seats as an option.",
            "In addition, the vehicles are equipped with a centre airbag, depending on the country. Pyrotechnic belt tensioners and force limiters are standard on all outer seats, as are seat belt height adjusters.",
            "Resource-conserving materials",
            "Numerous Mercedes-Benz E-Class Estate components are made partly from resource-saving materials (recyclates and renewable raw materials). Upholstery made of undyed alpaca wool combined with a recycled material is used for the basic seat. For the first time, certified recycled raw materials are used in the foam of the seats according to the \"mass balance approach\". These have the same properties as raw materials produced from petroleum. In this way, the need for fossil resources can be reduced while maintaining product quality.",
            "Neutral CO2 balance in production at the Sindelfingen plant",
            "Since 2022, Mercedes-Benz has been producing with a neutral CO2 balance in all of its own plants worldwide. The externally sourced electricity comes exclusively from renewable energies, and is therefore CO2-free. In addition, the company aims to increase the generation of renewable energy at its locations. Investments will be made in a further expansion of photovoltaics at the entire Sindelfingen location by the end of 2024. Another focus at the Sindelfingen location is on constantly reducing water consumption and the amount of waste produced.",
            "The E-Class Estate as a long-standing success story",
            "Mercedes-Benz has produced more than 16 million upper mid-range vehicles since 1946. In August 1966, the Mercedes-Benz Universal made its debut in the official sales programme. It was an estate car built by Belgian partner IMA on the basis of the 200 D to 230 S tail fin versions - the first official Mercedes-Benz estate car.",
            "In April 1978, the Estate 123 model series entered production and a long success story began - well over a million estate models have been built to date. In Germany, the Estate is known as the \"T-Modell\" and although the \"T\" suggests tourism and transport, it also stands for trendsetter. For Mercedes-Benz, the estate model is now an integral part of the luxury segment and has a loyal fan base, particularly in Germany. There has been an estate in every successive generation of the E-Class (S 124, S 210, S 211, S 212, S 213, as well an All-Terrain version since 2017).",
            "The exterior design",
            "As functional as its predecessor, as intelligent and customisable as never before: The new Mercedes-Benz E-Class Estate, model series 214, impresses in many areas. The design has also changed: The roofline is more dynamically designed compared to its predecessor, and at the same time the new E-Class Estate scores again with functionality and load compartment volume. Combined with the raked rear window, the overall appearance is progressive.",
            "Like the Saloon before it, the Estate not only continues the long model history of the classic E-Class, but also bridges the gap to the avant-garde trendsetters from Mercedes-EQ with its new design. Balanced proportions are part of the appearance of a classic estate car. They are defined by the short front overhang, the long bonnet with powerdomes, the longer wheelbase and the balanced rear overhang.",
            "With its distinctive side profile, the Estate clearly sets itself apart from the competition. The two character lines familiar from the Saloon create a powerfully stretched car body and give the Estate a sporty and stylish appearance. Sophisticated, three-dimensional and optimised down to the last detail, the surface finish exudes elegance. The E-Class Estate is equipped with the flush-fitting door handles familiar from the Mercedes-Benz luxury-class models. They extend electrically when the driver approaches or strokes the outer surface of the door handle. The attached roof rails combine form and utility. Light-alloy wheels with high-quality surfaces and up to 21 inches in size round off the expressive side view.",
            "Precisely designed chrome elements as well as the progressively styled, two-part lamps characterise the rear-end design. Thanks to its large opening, the load compartment can be used in a variety of ways. The design team has reinterpreted the rear lamps in terms of their contours and inner workings. With great depth of detail and partly animated functions, the interior design contributes to the vehicle's high value appeal. The unique star motif makes the day and night design of the rear lamps unmistakable. The two light sections in the side wall and boot lid are visually connected. This further emphasises the width of the rear. The reflectors have been relocated to the bumper. Because this allowed the load compartment opening to be particularly large, this increases the utility value on the one hand and makes the rear view look even wider on the other.",
            "Black-panel-like element at the front and illuminated radiator grille surround",
            "The connection between tradition and modernity is made particularly clear by a feature at the front: A black panel-like surface connects the radiator grille with the headlamps. This insert in high-gloss black is visually reminiscent of the Mercedes-EQ models. The three-dimensionally designed radiator grille is either progressive or classic, depending on the equipment line. In the Avantgarde version, the central star is integrated into the grille. Other design features of this line include a single louvre, grilles in a chrome star motif and chrome surrounds. In the Exclusive version, on the other hand, the radiator grille has three horizontal twin louvres. In addition, this version has an upright star on the bonnet.",
            "An illuminated radiator grille is optionally available for all lines (Avantgarde, Exclusive and AMG Line). It extends the side lights. At night or at dusk, white light is fed into the conductor via four LED modules. The two bundles consist of more than 1000 fine glass fibres. While driving, the radiator frame is illuminated in combination with the low beam. When stationary, the radiator grille adds another level of staging to the Coming Home and Leaving Home scenarios.",
            "The new E-Class has high-performance LED headlamps as standard. As an optional extra, DIGITAL LIGHT is available without and with a projection function (for further information, see separate chapter). All headlamps offer a distinctive day and night design. As a typical feature of the brand, the daytime running lights take the shape of an eyebrow.",
            "The interior design",
            "The dashboard makes for the digital experience in the interior. If the Mercedes-Benz E-Class Estate is equipped with the optional front passenger screen, the large glass surface of the MBUX Superscreen extends to the central display. Visually detached from this is the high-resolution driver display in the driver's field of vision.",
            "The contour of the cover glass is dynamic in design. For the central display, the glass surface is extended downwards accordingly. The profile becomes flat towards the outer edges. A narrow nozzle band nestles against the upper contour of the glass surface, connecting the central nozzle with the outer nozzles to form a single unit.",
            "The models without a passenger display feature a large trim element that extends to the centre. Visually detached, the central display appears to float above the concave surface of this trim element.",
            "The front section of the instrument panel is illuminated by the light strip of the Active Ambient Lighting. This runs in a wide arc from the windscreen, past the A-pillars and into the doors, so creating a spacious feeling in the way the door panels merge with the collar of the instrument panel to form a single unit. An apparently free-floating control array in the upper section of the door panels matches the look of the glass surfaces of the screens.",
            "The centre console is designed as a homogeneous unit and merges in a straight line into the lower section of the dashboard. At the front, a stowage compartment with lid and cup holders is integrated into the three-dimensionally shaped trim element. There is a soft padded armrest in the rear part of the centre console. USB ports are located in the compartment below.",
            "The door centre panel merges seamlessly into the armrest with a concave sweep. The front section here is designed as a metallic high-tech element. It serves as a grab and closing handle, and incorporates the switches for the power windows. Another highlight is the free-floating control array incorporating the door opener and the controls for the seat functions.",
            "The contours of the seat surface and backrest flow elegantly from the inside to the outside, and appear to float above the base of the seat thanks to their layer design. Indented vertical lines follow the outer contour, widening out towards the top. The association made here by the interior designers was with the organic beauty of shells. If the customer opts for leather upholstery, the seats are designed with elaborate longitudinal fluting, created in individual panels. The nappa leather seats feature quilted and perforated diamond patterns that follow the shape of the seat. The seat with MICROCUT offered as part of AMG Line interior is also perforated.",
            "Extensive range of interior colours and decorative trim",
            "The colour & trim concept conveys a technoid character. E-Class Estate buyers can choose between numerous interior colour combinations. The palette ranges from light beige combined with space grey, including a classy pearl effect, to the sophisticated tonka brown and the cool and technical-looking grey.",
            "The interior surfaces have a new fine-grain finish from the base trim level upwards, underlining the contemporary character. The interplay between analogue and digital sensory experience is further exemplified by the wide range of trims with innovative, natural or technoid surfaces. Exclusive to the E-Class is interior trim of open-pore wood - dark ash - which is backlit by the Mercedes-Benz pattern.",
            "In addition to other trim panels featuring open-pore woods, the \"MANUFAKTUR piano lacquer black flowing lines\" variant familiar from the S-Class is also available. Another highlight is interior trim in a silver-coloured metal-mix material. Its high-gloss finish gives it a very futuristic look.",
            "Customisable UI design",
            "The main icons on the central and optional passenger displays are now more clearly displayed, and also colour-coded to match smartphone tiles. This enables the driver to recognise them even more intuitively.",
            "With two display styles (Classic and Sporty) and three modes (Navigation, Assistance, Service), the graphics of the screens can be individualised. In the \"Classic\" style, the driver is greeted by the familiar display layout with the look of two dial instruments. Varying content with vehicle-related information is displayed between the two tubes.",
            "The \"Sporty\" style is dominated by the colour red, with a dynamically designed central rev counter. A holistically impressive colour experience is created in the interior by the optional seven colour themes of the ambient lighting.",
            "DIGITAL LIGHT",
            "The new Mercedes-Benz E-Class Estate features LED High Performance headlamps including Adaptive Highbeam Assist as standard. DIGITAL LIGHT and DIGITAL LIGHT with projection function are available as optional extras. Each headlamp contains a module with three extremely powerful LEDs whose light is refracted and directed by 1.3 million micro-mirrors. The micro-mirrors occupy the area of a thumbnail. A control unit with a powerful graphic processor uses an HDMI-like connection to generate a continuous video stream to the mirrors.",
            "The beam, divided into 1.3 million pixels, makes absolutely precise light distribution possible. Highbeam Assist Plus is highly accurate when masking out oncoming traffic or traffic signs. The light-dark boundaries and the light distribution for all other adaptive light functions are also displayed very precisely with DIGITAL LIGHT. This optimises the illumination of fog, motorway or city lights, for example. Based on data from the navigation maps, the topographic light takes driving up and down hills into account, especially crests and dips. For example, when driving over crests, the dazzling of oncoming traffic is reduced by early lowering of the light cone. When driving through dips in the road, the light cone can be raised to obtain the desired light range.",
            "If the E-Class Estate is equipped with DIGITAL LIGHT, DIGITAL LIGHT with projection function can also be subsequently activated as an on-demand feature via the Mercedes me Store. The system also includes these assistance functions:",
            "Starting with the new E-Class, Mercedes-Benz has redesigned these warning symbols so that drivers can recognise them even more intuitively on the road.",
            "DIGITAL LIGHT with projection function also communicates with the driver. When the vehicle is unlocked or locked, or when the engine is switched off, the headlamps and tail lamps react with a short light show. The animation function can be switched on and off via MBUX. The \"Digital Rain\" and \"Star Wave\" projections are available at market launch.",
            "With the DIGITAL LIGHT Custom Animations, individual welcome and goodbye animations will be possible. This will also include market-specific and seasonal animations, for example at Thanksgiving in the USA. The general and seasonal animations, stored in the back end, are selectable in the Mercedes me App.",
            "The characteristics as a towing vehicle",
            "Whether caravans, trailers for leisure or work, or bicycle racks - the E-Class Estate has always been a proven towing and transport vehicle. The new generation will also score points with trailer towers. On the one hand, the high towing capacities of 2100/750 kilograms (braked/unbraked) contribute to this. They apply to all models, including those with plug-in hybrid drive. On the other hand, numerous practical functions such as the optional Trailer Manoeuvring Assist and the Trailer Mode in the MBUX system make manoeuvring easier. The tongue weight is 84 kilograms - so the carrying of e-bikes is allowed.",
            "The optional trailer hitch can be folded in and out fully electrically. Operation is fully electric via the button in the tailgate or via the central display. As soon as the button light goes out, the hitch is correctly engaged and ready for use.",
            "In combination with the trailer hitch, the Estate is equipped with ESP® trailer stabilisation as standard. The safety system can intervene automatically in critical situations when driving with a trailer. The vehicle recognises the trailer automatically as soon as the electrical connector plug is connected. The ESP® stabilisation functions are automatically active from a speed of 65 km/h. If undesired weaving is detected, the trailer stabilisation system actively counteracts this with the help of wheel-specific, reciprocal braking interventions. In most cases, this is already enough to reduce dangerous vibrations. If necessary, the system reduces the vehicle speed as well: for this, the engine torque is reduced and the vehicle is braked via all four wheels.",
            "Adjust speed limits: Trailer mode in MBUX",
            "In a menu on the central display, the trailer type can be selected and the maximum permitted speed can be specified. This allows the vehicle to adapt the Speed Limit Assist functions for trailer operation.",
            "Depending on the market, the practical trailer route planner also takes into account restrictions for driving with trailers when navigating and avoids narrow roads or city centres - if possible.",
            "Manoeuvre more easily: Trailer Manoeuvring Assist (optional)",
            "Trailer Manoeuvring Assist (360° camera additionally required) handles reverse manoeuvring confidently and smoothly - even in difficult situations. This means that trailer towers benefit from the assisted control. It automatically regulates the steering angle on the towing vehicle at low speeds.",
            "Trailer Manoeuvring Assist is connected to MBUX and can be operated intuitively via its menu. At the beginning of the manoeuvring process, the user simply specifies the desired manoeuvre: a direction specification by entering the target articulation angle (max. 90°) or the function \"Pull straight\". The driver can view the manoeuvring process from different camera perspectives. Dynamic guidelines make it easier to gauge the travel path, vehicle width and distances.",
            "Aerodynamics and aeroacoustics",
            "With a cd figure from 0.26, the new Mercedes-Benz E-Class Estate performs very well in its vehicle segment. It thus undercuts the very good value achieved by its facelifted predecessor (0.27). The fact that this high level has been maintained with only a slight spread between the individual variants is remarkable. This is because certain factors make aerodynamic performance more difficult: This includes, for example, the large wheel portfolio from 17 to 21 inches. At 2.38 m2 , the frontal area A of the new E-Class is slightly larger than that of its predecessor (2.35 m2 ).",
            "Many computer simulations at an early stage increased the degree of maturity. This made fewer optimisation loops necessary in the wind tunnel. In close cooperation with their design colleagues, the aerodynamics team has specifically improved the E-Class Estate in numerous areas. Some details such as wheels with cladding inserts were adopted from the famously efficient Mercedes-EQ models. Here are the most important measures:",
            "\"Acoustic camera and acoustic holography\" with almost 500 microphones",
            "When it comes to aeroacoustic development, Mercedes-Benz always takes a dual approach: on the one hand, as little noise as possible should be generated at the source, i.e. when the air flows around the outer skin of the vehicle with all its mounted parts. And on the other hand, the quality of the sealing and sound insulation help to ensure that unavoidable wind noises are hardly perceptible in the interior, or not perceptible as disturbing.",
            "During the early development phase, the engineering team began to configure the geometric dimensions of the A-pillar and the exterior mirrors, which are particularly relevant for noise generation, accordingly. Advanced development methods using flow simulations and noise measurements were combined when optimising shapes: For the latter, a special microphone array was used in the acoustic wind tunnel. The extensive interior measurements are also called \"acoustic holography\". In this process, Mercedes-Benz uses 64 double microphones in the interior (hand array), which can locate problem areas in low-frequency ranges. Including the devices for outside measurements (\"acoustic camera\"), Mercedes-Benz uses almost 500 microphones.",
            "The high-frequency components of the wind noise were reduced by a variety of measures in the door seals, side windows and exterior mirrors. The structural rigidity of the doors was increased in the relevant areas. At very high driving speeds, this results in less wind noise. Cavities are foam-protected to improve the acoustic insulation in the body-in-white. This affects the structure of the cockpit cross-member and areas of the transmission tunnel and the A and C-pillars.",
            "In the panoramic sliding sunroof, many detailed improvements were made to the wind deflector and by adding side wind deflectors to the glass roof. The result is better noise comfort and reduced draughts. In the tilt position, the glass panel is lowered depending on the vehicle speed. This also ensures pleasant interior acoustics and reduces actual aerodynamic drag.",
            "The suspension",
            "The agile handling of the new E-Class Estate is due in large part to precise guidance of the front wheels by four control arms each. At the rear axle, an optimised multi-link independent rear suspension with five links ensures excellent wheel control and excellent straight-line stability. At both axles, the springs and dampers are combined in a single strut and are not involved in wheel guidance tasks, therefore the suspension responds with corresponding sensitivity. The front subframe and rear axle carrier decouple the suspension and body from vibrations and noise, and are part of the sophisticated comfort concept.",
            "All E-Class Estate models have single-chamber air suspension on the rear axle. This features a compact design, maintains ride comfort even with a full load on board and ensures that the vehicle remains horizontal even when laden. As standard, the mild hybrid models are equipped with an AGILITY CONTROL steel spring suspension. The rear-wheel-drive versions also have a selective damping system as standard.",
            "The AIRMATIC air suspension system: All-round level control included",
            "As an option, the new Mercedes-Benz E-Class Estate is available with all-round AIRMATIC air suspension with ADS+ continuously adjustable damping. The AIRMATIC suspension with air springs and adaptive ADS+ dampers responds very sensitively. The damping characteristics are controlled fully automatically for each individual wheel, and separately during rebound and compression. While driving, a sophisticated sensor system and algorithms set the dampers according to the quality of the road to ensure that, for example, driving over a bump with just one wheel is not transmitted to the entire axle and the interior.",
            "The all-round level control is another feature of AIRMATIC. It keeps the ground clearance constant irrespective of the vehicle load, but also makes changes when needed. To reduce air resistance and thus fuel consumption, the vehicle level is automatically lowered by 15 millimetres from a speed of 120 km/h in the COMFORT driving mode. At the same time the vehicle's centre of gravity is lowered, which improves driving stability.",
            "Drive system",
            "Thanks to systematic electrification and intelligent downsizing, the new E-Class sets new standards in efficiency. A fourth-generation plug-in hybrid will already be available at market launch. Others will follow (for the plug-in hybrid model, see separate chapter).",
            "The combustion engines are four and six-cylinder units from the current modular Mercedes-Benz engine family FAME (Family of Modular Engines). Accordingly, the engine range plays a major role in the flexibility of the international production network, with needs-based electrification.",
            "In addition to turbocharging, both the diesel and petrol engines feature intelligent support from an integrated starter-generator (ISG). They are therefore mild hybrids. Thanks to a new battery, the power of the electric motor has been increased from 15 to 17 kW and the boost torque to 205 Nm.",
            "The ISG uses a 48 volt on-board electrical system that ensures functions such as gliding, boosting or energy recovery, and makes significant fuel savings possible. The engines also start very rapidly and comfortably as a result, so that the start/stop function is almost as imperceptible to the driver as the transition from gliding with the engine switched off to strong acceleration under engine power. When idling, the intelligent interaction between the ISG and the combustion engine ensures outstandingly smooth running.",
            "Petrol models: with many innovations compared to the preceding power units",
            "The four-cylinder petrol engine (M 254) is initially available with 150 kW as the E200 - further output levels will follow. In the M 254, Mercedes-Benz has combined all the innovations of the FAME modular engine family in a single unit. They include NANOSLIDE® cylinder coating, CONICSHAPE® cylinder honing (trumpet honing) and the exhaust aftertreatment system positioned directly at the engine.",
            "A top model with an electrified in-line six-cylinder will round off the engine range at the top end.",
            "Diesel: current development level",
            "The E220d is powered by the OM 654 M. The electrification also includes the use of an electric refrigerant compressor for the air conditioning system.",
            "The OM654M in the E220d is charged by a single-stage turbocharger with variable turbine geometry and friction-optimised roller bearings. The turbocharger is tuned so that the engine responds quickly and delivers its power smoothly. The four-cylinder diesel is also up to date in terms of exhaust gas aftertreatment. Its components include:",
            "Transmission: automatic as standard",
            "The 9G-TRONIC transmission has been further developed and is used in all E-Class models. The electric motor, power electronics and transmission cooler have now moved into or to the transmission. Previously required lines are eliminated, which offers advantages with regard to installation space and weight. In addition, the efficiency of the transmission has been increased. Amongst other things, the optimised interplay with the electric auxiliary oil pump reduces the delivery rate of the mechanical pump by 30 percent compared with the predecessor - good for efficiency. Furthermore, it uses a new generation of the fully integrated transmission control with multi-core processor and new design and connectivity technology. In addition to the increased computing power, the number of electric interfaces has been drastically reduced, and the weight of the transmission controls have been cut by 30 percent compared with the predecessor.",
            "The driving assistance systems",
            "The driving assistance systems with which the E-Class Estate is equipped as standard include ATTENTION ASSIST, Active Brake Assist, Active Lane Keeping Assist, Parking Package with reversing camera and Speed Limit Assist. The status and activity of the driving assistance systems are shown as a full-screen view in the Assistance mode of the driver's display.",
            "Active Distance Assist DISTRONIC is standard equipment In Western Europe. The system relieves the driver by regulating the speed to match that of slower vehicles ahead. The desired safety distance can be set in several increments. In an easy-to-understand way, the Get Started app in MBUX explains how Active Distance Assist DISTRONIC works.",
            "With extended functionality: the Driving Assistance Plus package",
            "The Driving Assistance Package Plus is available as an optional extra. Components include Active Steering Assist, which assists with lane-keeping. As previously on motorways, the Mercedes-Benz E-Class Estate can now also start off automatically in city traffic and on country roads after coming to a standstill. This is possible in a time window of 30 seconds when the hands are on the steering wheel. Another new feature: if Active Steering Assist is no longer available because the lane markings are not clearly visible, it signals this to the driver by vibrations in the steering wheel. As before, if Steering Assist is not available, the steering wheel symbol in the driver display also changes from green to grey.",
            "Other features of this assistant include lane detection at low speeds additionally with 360° camera, very high availability and cornering performance on rural roads and improved lane centring on motorways. Depending on the situation, a driving position which is off the centre of the lane (e.g. formation of an emergency corridor, but also orientation via the edge of the carriageway on rural roads without centre markings) can be used.",
            "The other components of the Driving Assistance Plus package:",
            "Passive safety",
            "The safety concept of the E-Class Estate is based on an intelligently designed body with a particularly rigid passenger cell and specifically deformable crash structures. The restraint systems, e.g. seat belts and airbags, are specifically adapted to this. In the event of an accident, they can be activated in such a way that their protective effect for the occupants is adapted to the situation.",
            "With the aid of numerous numerical simulations, the safety experts at Mercedes-Benz have designed the vehicle structure for a high level of occupant protection. For the aspects of the vehicle configuration that are relevant in an accident, they not only took account of the legal requirements and the criteria of consumer protection organisations; they also considered internal requirements and test criteria derived from real-life accident findings.",
            "Modern restraint systems: protection for all passengers",
            "In addition to driver and front passenger airbags, a knee airbag on the driver's side is also standard. It can protect the legs from contact with the steering column or instrument panel in a severe frontal crash.",
            "The standard windowbags can reduce the risk of head injuries - due to contact with the side window, for example. In the event of a serious side-on collision, the window airbag on the side of the impact extends from the A- to the C-pillar like a curtain over the front and rear side windows. If a rollover is detected, the window airbags can be activated on both sides. In addition to the head protection system, side airbags can also protect the thorax area in the event of a severe side impact - including on the outer rear seats as an option.",
            "In addition, the vehicles are equipped with a centre airbag, depending on the country. This is integrated into the backrest of the driver's seat towards the centre console. It can position itself between the driver and the front passenger in the event of a severe side impact, depending on the direction of the impact, the severity of the accident and the occupancy status. Pyrotechnic belt tensioners and force limiters are standard on all outer seats, as are seat belt height adjusters.",
            "The Mercedes-Benz E-Class Estate has i-Size child seat attachments as standard on the two outer seats in the second row. With two anchors each between the seat backrest and the seat cushion, corresponding child seats can be installed particularly quickly and securely. Top-tether attachment points on the rear of the rear seat backrests provide additional support. If a rear-facing child seat is placed in the front passenger seat, the vehicle can automatically deactivate the passenger airbag as required, depending on the market.",
            "Warnings: if the belt is not worn and people and animals are forgotten",
            "The European version of the E-Class Estate not only has a seat belt status indicator for the rear, but also a sophisticated seat belt warning system. This warns the driver if the seat belt is not fastened when the seat is occupied.",
            "The occupancy reminder can help to indicate people or animals that may have been overlooked in the rear of the vehicle. It activates and deactivates itself automatically if prolonged opening of a rear door indicates that persons or animals have got in and are in the rear seats.",
            "When the vehicle is switched off, the driver receives the text message \"Do not leave persons or animals behind\" on the driver's display if the system has activated automatically beforehand. The customer has the option to deactivate the system. An indicator light shows the status of the system.",
            "PRE-SAFE® system: precautionary protection",
            "In Europe, the PRE-SAFE® preventive occupant protection system is standard in the E-Class Estate as part of the Advanced Package. This includes the known precautionary measures in the event of a recognised impending accident, including pre-conditioning of the hearing with PRE-SAFE® Sound.",
            "In conjunction with the Driving Assistance Plus package, PRE-SAFE® Impulse Side forms a kind of virtual crumple zone on the vehicle sides. As there is only a limited crumple zone available in a severe side impact, PRE-SAFE® Impulse Side can move the affected driver or front passenger away from the danger towards the centre of the vehicle even before the crash. To do this, as soon as the system detects that a side collision is imminent, air chambers in the side bolsters of the front seat backrests are inflated in fractions of a second before the collision."

Automatic rev matching makes the Type S more enjoyable to drive by minimizing driveline shock during shifts.",
            "The automatic rev matching has two operational profiles: Comfort and Sport+. In Comfort, the rev match system uses a seamless profile, designed to give the Type S a sporty but smooth and comfortable operation. In Sport+ mode, the system switches to a more aggressive, quick-revving profile designed to complement the faster paced shifting of performance driving. If the driver prefers not to use the rev match system, it can be disabled using the Type S' customizable settings menu.",
            "Helical Limited-Slip Differential",
            "A standard helical-type limited-slip differential (LSD) helps the Acura Integra Type S minimize wheel spin, putting more of the engine's power effectively to the pavement. Under power, the limited-slip differential works to equalize the speed of the two drive wheels. The system never locks the speed of the two drive wheels together as would a locking differential, but instead allows different wheel speeds to accommodate the longer distance the outer wheel must travel when cornering.",
            "The LSD enables the Type S to accelerate harder on surfaces with uneven traction, to reduce wheel spin when exiting corners, and to enhance the vehicle's responsiveness to throttle inputs in corners. The term \"helical\" describes the way the differential's gear teeth are cut - which is at an angle to the gear's shaft. Helical gears are quieter in operation and can transmit greater torque than straight-cut (or spur) gears.",

            "To minimize weight, the hood is aluminum, along with the front bumper beam, which features a cross section that improves strength while minimizing the overall amount of material required.",
            "Extensive use of structural adhesive is applied throughout the body structure to add strength while minimizing weight gain. The adhesive is applied where spot welds are performed, combining the strength of the weld and the broader surface area of the adhesive to increase the stiffness of the joint. This reduces the need for additional sheet metal thickness or welded-on reinforcements.",
            "Hot stamp steel is used on the door and windshield frames, with high-strength steel used in the door sills and body cross members. The application of these materials increases rigidity for improved handling and a quiet ride and improves crash safety performance with Integra's Advanced Compatibility Engineering™ (ACE™) body structure.",
            "Floor strength is enhanced via lattice frame members and by joining the front and rear ends of the center tunnel to the dashboard lower and rear crossmember. Circular frames are used around the engine compartment strut towers and behind the rear seats; the resulting stiffness helps achieve a better balance of front-rear rigidity, which helps improve steering feel and precision.",
            "Sharper Handling and Innovative Dual Axis Front Suspension",
            "For quick, accurate, intuitive dynamics, the Acura Integra Type S features a specially tuned chassis and an innovative dual-axis front suspension design with aluminum knuckles, strut forks and lower arms. Geometry is optimized for sport handling with more initial negative camber for crisper turn-in and more caster for additional stability than the standard Integra's front suspension.",
            "The dual axis system also greatly reduces torque steer, primarily through a 0.75-inch reduction in steering axis offset, even though the front track is 3.5-inches wider than that of the standard Integra. A thicker (+2 mm) 29.0 mm tubular stabilizer bar improves response.",
            "Specially tuned for the Type S, the multi-link rear suspension provides nimble handling in city driving and precise response for high-performance driving. Mounted on a rigid subframe, the system incorporates stamped-steel control arms, aluminum hub carriers and a thicker (.3 mm) 20.5 mm solid stabilizer bar, which helps provide crisp turn-in along with improved body control. In addition, the Type S rear control arms are supremely rigid and more negative wheel camber is utilized - all to increase handling response, cornering agility and overall stability.",
            "Adaptive Damper System",
            "Tuned exclusively for the Integra Type S is a standard Adaptive Damper System (ADS). Controlled through the standard Integrated Dynamics System (IDS), with distinct damping characteristics in Comfort, Sport and Sport+ driving modes, the specially tuned Adaptive Damper System provides precise control of ride and handling with optimized damping curves that adjust automatically to suit driving conditions, based on steering input, lateral G and suspension stroke.",
            "Wider 19-inch Wheels and High-Performance Tires",
            "Acura Integra Type S handling is further improved by lightweight 19-inch wheels that are 2.5 inches wider than the standard Integra's wheels and 1.5-inches wider than wheels on the Integra A-Spec. Despite being significantly wider, the Type S wheels are 6.5-percent lighter than the 18-inch A-Spec wheels.",
            "The new wheels are wrapped in stickier 265/30R19 Michelin Pilot Sport 4S high-performance summer tires that are 30 mm wider than the A-Spec's all-season tires.",
            "Improved Dual Pinion Variable Ratio Electric Power-Assisted Steering (EPS)",
            "The Integra Type S uses an upgraded dual-pinion electronic power steering (EPS) system with a stiffer torsion bar and improved software control resolution that enhance steering feel and controllability.",
            "The system provides substantially improved feel compared to a single-pinion system by using the physical steering input from the driver as well as from a supplemental electric motor. A non-contact torque sensor measures the driver's steering effort, and an ECU determines how much electric motor assist to add, with the result being seamless, natural feeling steering.",
            "The Integra's EPS system also features a variable gear ratio for comfortable responses near center and quicker, sportier feel with increasing steering angle, yielding intuitive response at all speeds for a sporty and confident character. Steering ratio is variable, with a final full off-center ratio of 11.6:1 and an on-center ratio of 14.9:1.

The bow beneath it is chiselled and features the new radiator grille and signature light pattern that Renault introduced on New Clio E-Tech full hybrid. The protruding bonnet and sculpted front bumper seem to impel the car forwards.",
            "The muscular shoulders carry presence around the rear wheels, hinting at the power propelling the car. The skid plate emerging from under the rear bumper also shows the car's presence while the sloping roofline with one last jut points to speed.",
            "\"To work, design has to be just as powerful and effective if you are standing 50 metres, 10 metres or 50 centimetres away. From a distance, what strikes you is the all new Renault Rafale's forceful face and proportions. When you draw nearer, it's the flowing line that wows you. And, close-up, it's the attention to detail that catches your eye and sparks your interest.\" Alexis Martot, Head of Exterior Design, Renault",
            "Ideal proportions",
            "The all new Renault Rafale is 4.71 metres long and 1.86 metres wide, squarely placing it in the D-segment. Added to which, it's 1.61 metres high, making it a quintessential sporty SUV.",
            "The car has a long wheelbase at 2.74 metres, while the roofline is flawlessly curved to provide plenty of headroom in the back seats and doesn't impinge on the rear windscreen.",
            "The rear windscreen tilts 17 degrees, which is exactly right for aerodynamic efficiency. And it renders rear wipers unnecessary, which keeps the car's lines pure.",
            "Meanwhile, its wider wheel track solidly grounds the vehicle and makes the most of the black parts of the wheels both from a vertical perspective (the wheels crop out slightly) and from a horizontal perspective (the 20-inch wheels fill the wheel arches).",
            "\"The all new Renault Rafale is sized to give it a status-symbol aura, its design is vibrant, and it has a powerful personality. So, it naturally stands out as the Renault brand's new flagship.\" Agneta Dahlgren, CMF-CD Design Project Director",

            "A moving radiator grille",
            "The all new Renault Rafale's novel radiator grille is built around the brand's hallmark diamond. It is made up of a constellation of small diamonds that arrange space in three dimensions around the emblem in the middle.",
            "This diamond black coloured pattern is a nod to the all new Rafale's premium credentials. It stands out against the iron blue or shadow grey hues (depending on the version) that appear and disappear in the background depending on where you look at it from - like works of optical art in the 1970s. This is Renault tipping its hat to Victor Vasarely, the Op Art movement's high priest, and to a surname that has left its mark in Renault's history: Victor's son Yvaral Vasarely designed the 1972 logo - to which the brand pays a \"moving\" tribute with its new Nouvel'R logo.",
            "\"The all new Rafale's grille moves the way clothes move over skin; the interplaying shadows, reflections and colours animate it, it looks like it's alive.\" Alexis Martot, Head of Exterior Design, Renault",
            "The radiator grille's design, which has a very complex structure, was created using artificial intelligence in a parametric modelling software application. This technology makes it possible to try out a plethora of patterns and interactions in space, by modifying dimensions, angles, situations, and other parameters.",
            "This type of software is used extensively in architecture. It for example helped to design the \"Bird's Nest\" Olympic stadium in Beijing.",
            "A new signature light pattern",
            "The New Clio E-Tech full hybrid was the first vehicle in Renault's line-up to feature the brand's new signature lights, and the all new Rafale is the second. The pattern unambiguously points to Renault: it's diamond-shaped, forceful and robust, and visually enhances the car.",
            "\"There is something jubilant about the way the diamond theme appears, and there's also a lot of freedom. It's everywhere in the design. The lights follow the same visual pattern as our logo and the oblique lines naturally bring the brand to mind.\" Agneta Dahlgren, CMF-CD Design Project Director",
            "Expanding lights",
            "To visually enhance car's width and add poise, the two rear lights are as far apart as they can be. They look like sculptures embedded in the edges.",
            "Their shape was inspired by Chinese tangram puzzles (a large square divided into five triangles, a parallelogram, and a smaller square). The micro-optic technology in them makes them spring to life when they are on, and they create a \"floating ice-cube\" effect when they are off.",
            "Two new colours",
            "The all new Renault Rafale will be available in five body colours including two previously unreleased ones: a new satin White Pearl and a new Alpine Blue tone.",
            "The first adds clarity by directing your gaze to the body's lines. It uses the same innovative technology as Austral's Shale Grey Satin, which derives its satin-matte look exclusively from the varnish and makes it resistant to UV rays, carwash rollers and other aggressions the car withstands day after day.",
            "The all new Rafale is the first Renault brand model to feature Alpine Blue. This tone has never quite stood still in the Dieppe-base brand's history. And it has changed again, if ever so slightly; on the all new Rafale, it is a shade deeper than on the Alpine A 110.",
            "The three other colours available for the all new Rafale are Flame Red, Diamond Black and gloss Ceramic Grey.",
            "THE PLATFORM AND POWERTRAINS: DRIVING PLEASURE AT ITS SOURCE",
            "The all new Renault Rafale is built on the Alliance's modular CMF-CD platform, which offers unparalleled possibilities for technological content, across the running gear, powertrains and technological equipment. Its 200 hp E-Tech full hybrid petrol powertrain, combined with its multimode automatic transmission, put its range among the longest and its CO2 emissions among the lowest in its segment. It will soon feature a new high-performance variant E-Tech 4x4 300 hp.",
            "Chassis: precision for pleasure",
            "Driving pleasure, one of the overarching goals when Renault was developing the all new Rafale's running gear, has reached new heights in this car that combines a multi-link rear axle with the latest upgrade to the 4CONTROL Advanced 4-wheel-drive system.",
            "Multi-link suspension enables the most efficient settings for road holding without hampering comfort, and muffles more of the noise from the undercarriage.",
            "The 4CONTROL Advanced 4-wheel-drive system significantly improves handling at low speeds, and boosts agility and vigour at average and high speeds.",
            "When you negotiate a turn at less than 30 mph, the rear wheels turn very slightly (up to 1 degree) in the same direction as the front wheels, reducing the rear wheels' inertia and improving the car's stability. At low speeds, the rear wheels turn up to 5 degrees in the opposite direction, providing unrivalled agility and shortening the all new Renault Rafale's turning radius to 10.4 metres (the same as a city car).",
            "While the all new Austral E-Tech full hybrid also come with a multi-link rear axle and 4CONTROL Advanced, the all new Rafale additionally features Vehicle Motion Control 2 (VMC 2), an upgraded electronic system governing the rear wheels. It anticipates loss of hold more effectively, so you can negotiate bends faster and know that all four wheels are in the optimal position on uneven and damaged roads. The all new Rafale also has a wider track, wider wheels (245 mm) and specific spring, shock-absorber and roll-bar settings, which optimise comfort as much as verve.",
            "Lastly, the agility of the chassis - with or without 4CONTROL Advanced - is amplified by the calibration of the steering and its very direct ratio (13), so you can enjoy a thrilling experience from the system's surgical precision on bends.",
            "\"The all new Renault Rafale is the result of a textbook case. When Luca de Meo took over as Renault's CEO, he asked us to extract the full potential from each platform. The all new Rafale does exactly that: it makes the most of the CMF-CD platform in terms of the car's dimensions, technology, and emotional power.\" Grégory Launay, Product Performance Leader, Renault Rafale",

            "This powertrain is powerful, economical, automatic and self-charging. It provides the best mpg figures in its segment (60.1 mpg and 105 g. CO2/km, pending certification) and a range that makes you want to hit the road (up to 683 miles of range). You can enjoy an optimal driving experience every time, and even enhance it with your own choice of MULTI-SENSE settings.",
            "\"The all new Rafale interlinks two Renault lineages: its motorsports heritage from the high-performance saloons like the R21 Turbo and Safrane Baccara Biturbo on one side, and the innovative spirit that brought about concepts like people carriers, turbo technology and E-Tech hybrid powertrains on the other.\" Grégory Launay, Product Performance Leader, Renault Rafale",
            "High-tech mechanisms",
            "The 200 hp E-Tech full hybrid powertrain has a \"series-parallel\" architecture. It encompasses a 3 cylinder 1.2 litre turbocharged 130 hp (96 kW) petrol internal combustion engine delivering 205 Nm of torque, and two electric motors. Even on its own, the internal combustion engine a technological gem, combining a Miller combustion cycle, low-pressure exhaust gas recirculation, a variable-geometry turbocharger and a diesel-engine-like long-stroke architecture. The result is an extraordinary 41% energy efficiency ratio. The main electric motor delivers 50 kW (70 hp) and 205 Nm. It is powered by a 2 kWh/400V lithium-ion battery for full-electric driving. The secondary electric motor is a 25 kW and 50 Nm High-voltage Starter Generator (HSG) that starts the engine and powers gear changes in the clutchless dog box.",
            "Efficient and long-lasting charges",
            "With its all-electric ignition and energy regeneration system that kicks in automatically when you slow down or brake, you can drive in electric mode 80% of the time in cities and use 40% less fuel than with an equivalent internal-combustion engine with this E-Tech full hybrid powertrain. You get the whole electric driving experience and none of the charging constraints.",
            "Charging is managed automatically by the smart gearbox, which taps into the engine and motors to top up the battery. The driver, however, can override the smart gearbox with a choice of four regenerative braking levels, using the paddles on the steering wheel.",
            "The multimode box",
            "The multimode automatic dog box derived from Formula 1 technology combines the main electric motor's two ratios and the internal combustion engine's four ratios. The 15 possible ways of combining the motors and engine will optimise driving pleasure, consumption or CO2 emissions depending on which you choose.",
            "The smart multimode box automatically selects the powertrain's mode, which can be all-electric, all-combustion, dynamic hybrid (the engine and motors move the wheels together), e-drive (the motor moves the wheels and the engine charges the battery) or regeneration (the motor taps into the kinetic energy).",
            "\"Our new 200 hp E-Tech full hybrid powertrain uses the electric motors as much as possible, whatever the circumstances, to optimise consumption. The fact that you can use the electric motor up to 80% of the time in cities ranks the car among the best in its category.\" Gwenaël Le Merrer, Head Engineer, Renault Rafale",
            "A high-performance E-Tech 4x4 300 hp version in the pipeline",
            "The all new Renault Rafale, which is designed for driving pleasure and performance levels never seen before in Renault's line-up, will later be enhanced with a substantially upgraded hybrid powertrain with all its settings optimised to unleash 300 hp.",
            "Optimising a variety of features will help to reach 300 hp, but most of the boost will come from two technical adjustments. The first is an additional electric motor on the rear axle, that will move the wheels directly, making the all new Rafale a 4-wheel-drive coupe-SUV. Then it will be a plug-in hybrid, so you can use the all new Rafale in full-electric mode for practically all your everyday outings and enjoy its ample range on long journeys without a worry in the world - and without missing out on any of the fun behind the wheel.",

The cockpit is 100% geared for driving pleasure but the car is nevertheless true to Renault's DNA and accordingly pampers all its passengers.",
            "Solarbay, a new darkening glass roof",
            "The pioneering, spectacular 1,470 mm by 1,117 mm Solarbay panoramic glass roof was developed by Saint-Gobain and the all new Renault Rafale is the first car in the world to use this iteration of it. Its AmpliSky technology replaces standard screens with a full active system that darkens each of its segments on demand, using electric fields to displace molecules. It provides maximum protection from the sun in seconds, and the sequential darkening of the nine segments across the glass surface is exhilarating to watch. This smart glass roof can be voice-controlled via Google Assistant and has a switch by the ceiling light to control it manually.",
            "The driver and passengers can choose between four roof settings: all light, all dark, light in the front and dark behind, and the reverse. It is more practical than a standard sunshade because the passengers in the back can let the sunlight in even if the people in the front prefer not to. The Solarbay roof also provides an extra 30 mm of headroom, which makes a significant difference - especially for passengers in the rear of a coupe. The car doesn't feel like a hothouse or icebox: Saint-Gobain's laminated glass keeps the temperature comfortable in summer and winter, like automatic sunshades. And the glass darkens automatically when you step out of the car.",
            "Solarbay darkening glass roofs use Polymer Dispersed Liquid Cristal (PDLC) technology derived from the construction industry and tweaked for car occupants. So far, only ultra-premium carmakers have fitted it, plus the all new Renault Rafale is the first car from a full-line automotive manufacturer to use it with the partial roof darkening feature.",
            "\"This Solarbay darkening glass roof is the perfect example of the useful, simple-to-use technology we wanted for the all new Renault Rafale. It is more efficient than a standard sunshade on every score. Plus, it's smarter and easier to use. And it produces that wow effect!\" Gwenaël Le Merrer, Head Engineer, Renault Rafale",
            "Sporty seats",
            "The all new Renault Rafale's completely new seats have reinforced sides to match the car's dynamic behaviour with thorough lateral and longitudinal support. Among other upsides, they make the chassis' road holding on turns even more exciting.",
            "The Alcantara upholstery helps to keep the driver upright, adds to the sporty feel and is eco-friendly (it is the first 61% recycled Alcantara interior).",
            "\"To bolster the Grand Tourisme effect, the side reinforcements on the seats are gadrooned, like the reinforcements on biker jackets.\" François Farion, Design Director, Colour & Trim, Renault Group",
            "A light logo on the seats",
            "In the all new Renault Rafale's esprit Alpine trim, the Alcantara on the seats is perforated so you can catch a glimpse of the blue fabric lining and its iridescent effect - which will remind you of the radiator grille. The A-and-Arrow logo at the top of the seat back literally lights up and flashes in synch with a beating human heart - an allegory for the surging excitement you feel when you draw near the car. The lighting adjusts to match the colour you selected in the MULTI-SENSE settings. The lights are embedded in a completely flexible fabric, so they don't stiffen the seat back in the slightest. This technology is being used for the first time worldwide here.",
            "\"The all new Renault Rafale recognises its driver coming towards it and the lights in the Alpine logo on the seats beat like a heart, signifying the close connection between them. An invitation to driving pleasure has never been expressed with so much passion.\" Agneta Dahlgren, CMF-CD Design Project Director",
            "Three-colour overstitching",
            "Producing the red, white and blue overstitching in the passenger compartment of the the All new Renault Rafale's esprit Alpine trim involved building a new three-head machine to sew three threads simultaneously.",
            "A steering wheel like nothing you have felt before",
            "The all new Renault Rafale's steering wheel is derived, with only minor tweaks, from the Megane E-Tech electric's and Austral's. Here, the Renault emblem's oblique lines are smithed into the centre and the bright black medallion is gone. The esprit Alpine trim has an Alcantara inlay inside the lower part of the steering wheel. And Renault has used a TEP-like material (including 34% of recycled material on the reverse side), that feels even better than leather, to replace all animal products without affecting driving pleasure or watering down the tantalising sensation. Renault has reasserted its aim of no longer using leather by 2024.",
            "Natural, innovative materials",
            "The all new Renault Rafale is the first car worldwide to include dyed cork and slate in its passenger compartment. In the esprit Alpine trim, the slate evokes the Alpine universe in a very real way. It clads the dashboard on the passenger side and the hand-rest. These extra-thin slate sheets are not rough in the slightest and bend around shapes as effortlessly as a sheet made from wood. The Techno trim has cork dyed black - providing a premium feel - on the dashboard. Besides serving a decorative purpose, it is extremely lightweight and non-reflective.",
            "Generously sized",
            "Driving pleasure may be driver-centred, but journeys are more enjoyable with others. The all new Renault Rafale is uncompromising on the former doesn't cut corners when it comes to indulging passengers: its passenger compartment is generously sized all around. The car's lengthy 2.74 metre wheelbase opens up a comfortable 302 mm knee radius in the back. The long wheelbase also makes for more headroom under the sloping roof - 880 mm in the back seat - without affecting the coupe silhouette.",
            "As long journeys often involve lots of luggage, the all new Rafale has a very roomy 647-litre boot.",
            "\"After driving your family around in an SUV or people carrier, the all new Rafale is the car you choose when you want to thoroughly enjoy driving - and seat two young adults comfortably in the back.\" Grégory Launay, Product Performance Leader, Renault Rafale",
            "A high-tech rear armrest",
            "One example of all the care that went into keeping back-seat passengers comfortable and connected is the all new Renault Rafale's innovative centre armrest, which is designed for the multimedia devices that make life on board more enjoyable. This high-tech armrest has two USB power outlets, storage space for tablets and smartphones, and two foldout screen stands for comfortable viewing.",
            "New screen graphics",
            "The all new Renault Rafale's OpenR digital cockpit - which was introduced in the Megane E-Tech 100% electric then tweaked for all Austral E-Tech full hybrid, is made up of two adjacent tiles arranged into an L shape: a horizontal TFT 321 sq. cm. 12.3 inch diagonal display on the dashboard (1920 x 720 pixels, landscape format) and a vertical 453 sq. cm. 12 inch diagonal touchscreen in the middle of the console (1250 x 1562 pixels, portrait format).",
            "OpenR is precisely positioned to be easy to see and reach, so the driver can enjoy the multimedia system without taking their eyes off the road. The navigation experience enhanced by the Google ecosystem has been extensively tried and tested and has emerged as a benchmark in its field. The system's visual interface is brand new, befits the all new Rafale's unprecedented, spectacular looks, and underlines the car's character and technology.",
            "The user-interface designers created a new, trailblazing visual atmosphere. Like the vehicle's exterior and interior design, it stems from the brand's new emblem and captures its visual force. The diamond is there subliminally, in the form of a 28° rising diagonal segment. This diagonal line is everywhere, providing the pattern to display information on the dashboard and centre tile that combine to form the OpenR screen.",
            "On the dashboard display facing the driver, the usual circle has been replaced by the 28° diagonal line - the speed line - that changes colour when the engine increases in revs or the car speeds up. The new font on the screens is bold and flattened, so the display blends beautifully with the latest digital universes on smartphone and laptop screens. The colours are pop - which the Renault brand loves - with silky shading, made possible by the OpenR screen's fantastic display.",
            "The centre display uses Google's system for natural, intuitive navigation. It looks and feels a lot like browsing around a smartphone. Each MULTI-SENSE setting displays a new dashboard, with its own distinct colours, and the vehicle's shape on the screen is the same colour as the car's body.",
            "\"When we introduced the OpenR Link multimedia system on the Megane E-Tech 100% electric, it redefined the driving experience and became a benchmark in its field. On the all new Rafale, we adjusted the style and soundscape to match the car's compelling personality. The subtle colour shading is not something you see often in human-machine interaction. The experience in this car is bigger than the journey!\" Romain Mottier, Head of Experience Design, Renault Group",
            "An upgraded head-up display",
            "The all new Renault Rafale pays tribute to its name and to the aviation world with a new, improved and extra-large (9.3 inch) head-up display. The car's speed, active driver assistance systems, speeding warning and driving directions are projected directly onto the windscreen, for optimal visibility in all circumstances. The driver can thus remain fully focused on the road - for even more intense driving pleasure.",
            "Adjustable lighting moods",
            "To enhance the experience in the passenger compartment, the all new Renault Rafale provides a variety of fun and friendly possibilities in its MULTI-SENSE settings. You can for example select the Living Lights colour you prefer, which stretches across the LED strip on the dashboard and door panels. Meanwhile, for a relaxing experience, the lighting includes an automatic mode that adjusts every 30 minutes to suit your 24-hour circadian clock and the time of day (with cold colours during the day and warm ones at night).",
            "CONNECTIVITY AND SAFETY - CUTTING-EDGE AND INTUITIVE TECHNOLOGY",
            "The all new Renault Rafale comes with the full array of technology for the Alliance's ultramodern CMF-CD platform - the platform used on the all new Austral E-Tech full hybrid. It includes advanced driver assistance systems (ADASs) and OpenR Link. OpenR Link comes with several new features, and artificial intelligence provides new services for the driver and passengers. Its universe is open and scalable, to always keep the car at the leading edge of technology.",
            "Seamless connectivity",
            "With the all new Renault Rafale, there are no borders between your digital life outside and inside the car, and between your smartphone and the car's OpenR Link multimedia system with built-in Google capabilities.",
            "The system comes with Google Maps, Google Assistant and many other apps (up to 35 apps for UK markets) from the Google Play catalogue. It's exactly like using a smartphone. The interface is also fully customisable, connects by wire or wirelessly, and is compatible with smartphones running Android Auto or Apple Carplay.",
            "In addition to its new design, the OpenR Link multimedia system on the All new Rafale uses Android Automotive 12 (instead of Android Automotive 10), which among other improvements makes it easier to pair devices via Bluetooth and simplifies navigation in some menus. The predictive maintenance feature is also more advanced: it can now warn the driver when the wheels will need aligning and when the air conditioning mechanism will need servicing.",
            "OpenR Link is scalable and connects to the cloud to automatically download recommended updates using FOTA (Firmware Over The Air) technology. So there's no need to stop at a garage or dealership to stay up to date.",
            "Useful artificial intelligence",
            "There are several AI-powered capabilities inside the all new Renault Rafale, and they are all there to help the driver and passengers. In many cases, the system proactively makes suggestions - for instance to switch off the air conditioning if a window is open or to switch it on if it is too warm inside. These proactive recommendations are based on \"routine\" patterns that the AI system picks up and analyses as time goes by.",
            "Added safety without diminishing pleasure",
            "For optimal, stress-free driving pleasure, the all new Renault Rafale comes with 32 advanced driver assistance systems (ADASs) divided into three categories: driving, safety and parking. And it now includes Intelligent Speed Assist (ISA), a system that automatically alerts the driver if the car's speed exceeds the limit it reads on road signs.",
            "What's more, Safety Score and Safety Coach are there to provide added peace of mind for the driver.",
            "Smart, efficient lighting",
            "The all new Renault Rafale's headlights are powered by technology that optimises them in all circumstances. All versions come with LED Adaptative Vision technology, which adjusts dipped headlights according to driving conditions. With LED Matrix Vision technology, available higher up the range, the driver can keep the full-beam lights on all the time, improving their visual comfort without dazzling drivers in other vehicles.",
            "The Active Driver Assist system",
            "This new-generation motorway and traffic assistant equates to Level 2 autonomous driving on all types of roads (no longer only expressways). It does this by combining Adaptive Cruise Control with Lane Keeping Assist and factors in geolocation data and specific maps enabling the car to adapt predictively to the road.",
            "The Active Driver Assist system's built-in technology to read traffic signs and warn the driver if they are driving over the speed limit (Over Speed Prevention, OSP) can also be used by itself. For extra peace of mind, the driver can also let OSP take over the car's cruise control.",
            "For full control over the Active Driver Assist system, a real-time model of the vehicle's position in its lane, along with and other people, cars and objects on the road, can also be displayed on the dashboard.",
            "Other ADASs",
            "QUALITY - A TOP PRIORITY THROUGHOUT DEVELOPMENT",
            "Alongside the Megane E-Tech 100% electric and all new Austral E-Tech full hybrid, the new Rafale is part of the Renault brand's Renovation in the C and D segments, which centres on extraordinary products offering quality craftsmanship and up-to-the-minute technology.",
            "Intensive and varied tests",
            "The all new Renault Rafale is built on the CMF-CD platform, which has been enhanced based on the experience gathered over the two years it has been used by Austral.",
            "Like all other new Renault models since the Megane E-Tech electric, the all new Rafale will undergo Confirmation Runs, a complementary real-life test-drive protocol introduced under the Quality strategic plan. These tests are conducted in addition to the certification cycles by professional test drivers on the tracks at the Aubevoye Test Centre and external tests in extreme hot and cold weather. The goal with the Confirmation Runs is to anticipate customer feedback by entrusting several vehicles to a large number of Renault Group employees before the model reaches the market. This new process generates a wide array of feedback covering an ample variety of use cases, to identify the final opportunities to fine-tune the car and ensure it meets the highest driving-pleasure, quality and reliability standards.",
            "Over 100 employees will drive the car in all kinds of weather and cities across Europe, and on all kinds of roads and motorways. Engineering and test drivers will have driven all new Austral E-Tech full hybrid and all new Rafale a total of nearly 2 million miles on these Confirmation Runs. They are tasked with providing precise feedback using an app on their smartphone, so the brand's engineers and experts can collect and analyse data practically in real time. This way, they can identify possible anomalies long before they occur with a customer behind the wheel, and ensure the car's lifelong quality, reliability and durability.",
            "Palencia, a plant at the forefront",
            "The all new Renault Rafale will be produced at the Palencia plant in Spain. The Group invested substantially in this plant in preparation for the all new Austral E-Tech full hybrid launch. These investments ensure top production and operation quality for the three vehicles and their equipment. Two new ultramodern calibration benches were for example installed to make sure the latest-generation technological equipment works properly and reliably.",
            "At the Palencia plant, the all new Renault Rafale's roof is braze-welded onto the car. This weld is completely invisible on the body, so it is an improvement on the usual welding spots (there is no need to add a plastic cover around the roof to hide the spots). Combined with the roof's extra-slim and extra-modern design, this technique improves the car's perceived quality. You can also sense the quality inside, for example in the new felt fabric covering the glove compartment and the storage bins in the doors.",

            "The new BMW M2 comes as standard with an eight-speed M Steptronic transmission with Drivelogic. However, a six-speed manual gearbox is optional, which creates a performance experience in the classical mould. The gear ratios and gear spread are perfectly matched to the performance characteristics of the engine. A precisely defined shift action enables rapid, easily executed gear changes. Plus, the Gear Shift Assistant uses engagement speed control to ensure slip-free operation when downshifting under braking into corners. It can be deactivated in the M Setup menu.",
            "The eight-speed M Steptronic transmission is also distinguished by ratio spacing perfectly matched to the engine's characteristics and offers sporty gear shifts. The broadly spread gears assist efficiency at low engine speeds while enabling an intense build-up of power from low road speeds.",
            "As well as the new-look selector lever, there are shift paddles on the steering wheel for performing manual shifts with sequential gear selection. It is also possible to execute multiple downshifts to the lowest available gear in manual mode for a sudden burst of acceleration. M Steptronic does not force upshifts under acceleration in manual mode - even when the engine's revs hit the limiter.",
            "The transmission's shift characteristics can be varied using the Drivelogic button integrated into the selector lever, with a choice of three clearly distinguishable settings available in both automated and manual mode. Besides a more comfort-oriented setup and a setting for sporty driving, drivers are also able to activate a track-optimised configuration for the shift characteristics.",
            "Examples fitted with the optional six-speed manual gearbox accelerate from 0 to 62mph in 4.3 seconds, while cars with the eight-speed M Steptronic transmission cover the same sprint in 4.1 seconds. The new BMW M2 powers from 0 to 124mph in 14.3 seconds (automatic: 13.5 seconds). Top speed is electronically limited to 155mph, although this can be raised to 177mph with the optional M Driver's Package.",
            "Exceptional dynamics, optimal traction: rear-wheel drive and the Active M Differential",
            "By sending its power to the rear wheels, the new BMW M2 is embracing the traditional recipe for converting engine output into dynamic performance.",
            "Another contributor to the assured dynamics of the BMW M2 is its standard Active M Differential. It can halt rotational speed compensation between the rear wheels whenever required and generate a locking effect of up to 100 per cent. The Active M Differential is linked with the DSC (Dynamic Stability Control) system to adapt its locking effect precisely to the driving situation.",
            "Sophisticated chassis technology originally developed for the BMW M3/BMW M4 endows the new BMW M2 with all the tools required to convert the power of its straight-six engine into sublime straight-line and lateral performance. At the same time, the compact dimensions, short wheelbase, excellent longitudinal and torsional stiffness of the body and chassis mountings that is optimised by M-specific bracing, and the almost perfectly balanced 50:50 weight distribution, combine to deliver precisely controllable, fingertip handling. Add rear-wheel drive to the mix and the result is pure driving pleasure.",
            "M Servotronic steering and adaptive M suspension as standard",
            "The M Servotronic steering facilitates accurate turn-in when powering through bends on the one hand and effortless parking and manoeuvring on the other. It does so by combining the benefits of speed-sensitive power assistance and a variable steering ratio. There is a choice of two settings for steering response in the M Setup menu - Comfort and Sport.",
            "The adaptive M suspension that also comes as standard features electronically controlled dampers designed to maximise road contact and traction in all driving situations. The dampers are controlled with the help of sensors that keep a constant eye on body movements, the condition of the road and steering adjustments. The basic damper characteristics can be varied as desired by selecting one of the three settings in the M Setup menu.",

Measuring 19-inch at the front and 20-inch at the rear, they are shod with tyres measuring 275/35 ZR19 and 285/30 ZR20 at the front and rear respectively. Track tyres are also available as an option, in conjunction with the M Race Track Package.",
            "M Drive Professional with M Traction Control also fitted as standard",
            "The inclusion of the integrated braking system enables the DSC (Dynamic Stability Control) system to act with even greater dynamism and precision. Its range of functions includes M Dynamic Mode, which allows extra wheel slip at the push of a button to induce an exceptionally sporty driving experience. The wheel slip limitation function has been integrated into the engine management on the new BMW M2. This eliminates the long signal paths to the DSC control unit, meaning that the corrective inputs are applied up to ten times faster than in conventional systems and with exceptional precision.",
            "The M Traction Control function included as part of the M Drive Professional allows drivers of the new BMW M2 to set individual intervention thresholds for wheel slip limitation; they can choose from ten stages of precisely defined slip permitted at the driven wheels. During outings on the track, drivers can therefore carefully reduce the extent of control system inputs to configure a setup for controlled drifts that is tailored to the track and their personal preferences.",
            "Compact dimensions fused with powerful proportions",
            "The BMW M2's sporty credentials are showcased by the two-door car's compact dimensions. Measuring 4,575mm from nose to tail, 1,887mm wide and 1,403mm in height, it is 114mm longer than its predecessor, 16mm wider and 11mm lower. It is 219mm shorter than the BMW M4 Coupé models.",
            "The 2,747mm wheelbase of the new BMW M2 makes a prominent contribution to its fingertip agility. It is 110mm shorter than that of the BMW M4 Coupé but 54mm longer than its predecessor, delivering more legroom in both rows of seats. Its track widths have increased by 38mm (to 1,617mm) at the front and 4mm (to 1,605mm) at the rear. This means they precisely match the figures for the BMW M4 Coupé, which further highlights the difference in dimensions compared with the BMW 2 Series Coupé: the high-performance model is 49mm wider, with a 44mm wider track at the front and 18mm wider rear track.",
            "M-specific design features accentuate the performance-led character",
            "The car's powerfully sculpted form marks a clear differentiation from the BMW 2 Series Coupé, which is also emphasised by its wide stance and M-specific design features that optimise cooling air routing and aerodynamic balance.",
            "The front end is headlined by its large, horizontal and frameless BMW kidney grille. The elements of the M-typical three-section lower air intake have almost rectangular contours and maximise cooling of the powertrain components and brakes. Adaptive LED Headlights with BMW Selective Beam non-dazzling High-beam Assistant and M lights Shadow Line with dark inlays are standard.",
            "Lightweight M Carbon roof as standard",
            "Prominently flared side skirts team up with broad wheel arches to create an appearance that is characteristic of BMW M and inspired by racing cars. The car's silhouette is shaped by its long bonnet, short overhangs and set-back passenger compartment. The roofline swooping down from the B-pillar, and the short boot lid culminating in a pronounced spoiler lip add to its distinctive style.",
            "The new BMW M2 comes with a lightweight M Carbon roof as standard. With its dark colouring, the exposed structure of its carbon-fibre-reinforced plastic (CFRP), and a central cut-out, the M Carbon roof makes a stand-out visual impression as well as contributing to the car's weight-saving measures.",

            "Mercedes-Benz presented a new sports car study. The Vision One-Eleven combines a highly dynamic design language with innovative all-electric powertrain technology. The supercar silhouette is characterised by skilful execution of the signature Mercedes-Benz One-Bow design that is a marker of its 21st-century style. The development of this design underscores the positioning of the Mercedes-Benz brand, which stands for ICONIC LUXURY. Its technical highlights include the extremely powerful and highly efficient axial-flux motor developed by electric motor specialist YASA. The British company has been a 100-percent subsidiary of Mercedes-Benz AG since July 2021.",
            "The Mercedes-Benz Vision One-Eleven is inspired by the tradition of the legendary C 111 experimental vehicles from the 1960s and 70s, which were used to test revolutionary Wankel and turbodiesel engines. They were also prototypes for testing polymer-based bodyshells. The extremely (aero)dynamic mid-engine sports cars are considered design icons of their era, not least due to their distinctive gullwing doors and eye-catching orange-and-black paintwork.",
            "\"Our goal at Mercedes-Benz is not to do styling - our goal is to create icons. To me, that makes the difference between mainstream design and luxury. Design icons like the Type 300 SL and C 111 - both with gullwing doors - are part of our DNA. These legendary vehicles were major inspirations for the iconic design of the Mercedes-Benz Vision One-Eleven. This is beauty and the extraordinary united in one vision of the future. Our all-electric vision show car is the modern-day interpretation of the C 111, which was avant-garde at the time. The element of surprise comes from its exceptionally clean, purist and, at the same time, extremely muscular proportions. This iconic clarity is also reflected in the interior. The equally sensual but minimalist design language stands for ICONIC LUXURY by Mercedes-Benz.\" Gorden Wagener, Chief Design Officer, Mercedes-Benz Group AG",
            "\"The Mercedes-Benz Vision One-Eleven combines breathtaking design with groundbreaking powertrain technology. Like its historical namesake, it explores new paths for the future of sporting performance. At the heart of the compact and extremely efficient powertrain is the innovative YASA axial-flux high-tech electric motor. It offers a motorsport-like power output from a considerably smaller package. This makes the YASA axial-flux motor ideal for electric high-performance vehicles. Combined with the liquid-cooled cylindrical-cell battery with Formula-1 inspired cell chemistry, the Mercedes-Benz Vision One-Eleven is yet another proof point for the broad performance spectrum encompassed by our four-pronged development strategy for electric drive.\" Markus Schäfer, Member of the Board of Management of Mercedes-Benz Group AG, Chief Technology Officer",
            "The exterior - One-Bow design in its most athletic form",
            "The body of the Mercedes-Benz Vision One-Eleven centres on skilful execution of the One-Bow design. From the low-slung front end to the muscular hind quarters, it runs in a smooth bow that endows the just 1,170 mm-high vehicle silhouette with an extremely sculptural feel. This harmonises perfectly with the copper-orange alubeam paintwork. It provides an unmistakeable reference to the distinctive colour of the C 111 without adopting it one-to-one. The colour of the Mercedes-Benz Vision One-Eleven is considerably more powerful than that of the C 111 and also changes with the light. It conveys not only a sense of quality but also a certain extravagance.",
            "Further notable features of the side view include the flush-fit gullwing doors and the side windows, which are opaque from the outside and camouflaged by a pixelated pattern. Yet another is the large-diameter wheels inserted seamlessly into the wheel arches beneath voluminous flared wings. This reinforces the impression of an uncompromisingly sporty and aerodynamically refined driving machine. The wheel design incorporates powerfully structured elements evocative of electric motor windings - a clear indicator of the state-of-the-art, all-electric powertrain underpinning the Mercedes-Benz Vision One-Eleven. They stand in spirited contrast to the vehicle's iconic, minimalist and smooth surface design, which is more akin to a sculptural art piece. This contrast is typical of the X-factors the brand applies to its design thinking and a distinctive feature of the Vision One-Eleven.",
            "Another striking contrast arises through the very low-slung front and rear skirts finished in matte black. The two deeply scooped aerodynamic elements are visually connected by two blade profiles in the same colour running along the flanks beneath the sills. These profiles feature piercings that are backlit in blue. The functional aerodynamic elements also serve as a further design reference to the C 111, which is painted black on the lower portion of its bodyshell. The dark \"keel line\" of the Mercedes-Benz Vision One-Eleven generates an impression of seamless transition between the vehicle and the ground beneath it that is even more powerful than that of the C 111. The form of the car appears fused with the road surface.",
            "The front-end design - iconic high-tech look with historical reference",
            "From the frontal aspect, too, the Mercedes-Benz Vision One-Eleven is powerfully evocative of the C 111. In detail, however, there are striking differences: One stand-out example is the distinctive front end, which on both vehicles consists of a low-lying rectangular element with rounded ends left and right. On the C 111, this is a closed plastic element with a honeycomb structure, fitted with round foglamps. The corresponding part on the Vision One-Eleven appears very similar at first glance. However, upon closer inspection, it reveals itself as a high-tech feature. The panel is a flexible external display with a 3D pixelated look. It interprets the C 111's characteristic round lights in digitised form and can also convey messages to other road users.",
            "In contrast to the C 111, the Mercedes-Benz Vision One-Eleven bears a U-shaped and strongly profiled front apron. Above the slender light band, both forefather and descendant show further similarities, most notably the black air intakes on the bonnet.",
            "The rear-end design - aerodynamic features and digital elements",
            "The rear-end of the Mercedes-Benz Vision One-Eleven is likewise dominated by a powerfully profiled diffuser. Spanning the breadth above it is a display that echoes the shape of its counterpart at the front end and features the same pixelated structure in the red taillights. Similar to the blade profiles along the sides, blue lighting effects are also visible at the rear. The inner face of the wheels is fitted with circular lighting elements.",
            "The interior design - first sports car interior with a lounge concept",
            "Inside, the Mercedes-Benz Vision One-Eleven presents the first sports car interior with a lounge concept. It reflects the paradigm shift from self-driven sports car to autonomous electric vehicle within the super sportscar segment and unites two completely different states of being. In race mode with the backrest upright and the compact driver-oriented touchscreen, the interior becomes that of a minimalist driving machine. Conversely, in lounge mode, the seats are fully integrated into the interior sculpture, which merges sills, centre tunnel and luggage compartment into a single unit.",
            "This creates a whole new, exceptionally airy spatial concept. In contrast to previous mid-engine sports cars, it takes advantage of the compact proportions of electric motors to extend the interior rearwards. Consequently, the lounge-like interior invites occupants to take their time and relax - a completely new approach for the sports car of the future.",
            "Futuristic and luxurious ambience with contrasting colours",
            "The interior design of the Vision One-Eleven reflects future luxury based on a progressive colour concept and extraordinary material combinations. The richly contrasting colours and materials attract attention at first glance: Large surfaces such as the dashboard are upholstered in white fabric displaying a tech-look honeycomb structure. The material is made from 100-percent recycled polyester. Other elements such as the armrests on the sills and centre console, as well as the rear parcel shelf beneath the expansive rear windscreen, are clad in bright orange leather. This creates a smooth transition from interior to luggage compartment. The sustainably processed leather was tanned using coffee bean husks. Polished aluminium in the steering-wheel spokes and inlaid as straps across the armrests underscore the tech look and feel. The same applies to the brake and accelerator pedals, both of which are made from polished aluminium and floor mounted.",
            "Otherwise, the interior equipment in the Mercedes-Benz Vision One-Eleven has been reduced to a minimum. Like the exterior, the task here too was to keep the number of add-on features to a bare minimum. The seats are good examples as they don't follow the classic format. Instead, the seat cushions are integrated flush-fit into the floor. This creates the initial impression of the bucket seat in a Formula 1 race car. The orange four-point harness and its high-gloss polished buckle further reinforce the sporting character.",
            "Nevertheless, the innovative seats combine this sporting feel with luxurious comfort because, unlike in a Formula 1 race car, the angle of the backrest can be adjusted. The silver shimmer of their diamond-quilted upholstery is another eyecatcher that underscores the first-class interior ambience. Between the seats is a compact centre console, freestanding in space like a work of art.",
            "The only highly complex feature in the interior is the leather-clad steering wheel, which is fitted with various functional controls and state-of-the-art touch elements. This is complemented by a compact touchscreen with high-resolution display mounted to the side of the steering wheel and angled towards the driver. It shows all relevant vehicle information as required.",
            "Fusion of analogue and digital - UI/UX with retro-futuristic pixel-look",
            "The contrast to the modern interior is provided by the slender pixel display spanning the entire breadth of the dashboard, picking up on the form of the front and rear light bands. Here too, the pixel structure is intentionally coarse, which gives the information displayed - such as the current speed - a strikingly bold appearance. Moreover, the 3D pixel display shows digital art pieces as a coarsely rasterised stream of QR codes in the style of \"early digital\" news tickers. This is done with the help of glass pixels that show a changing colour gradient depending on the viewing angle. The corresponding real image then appears razor sharp on the high-resolution screen next to the steering wheel.",
            "This combination of vastly differing representations of the same image embodies a further interpretation of the MBUX Hyperscreen with a focus on flexible interfaces. The retro-futuristic, 8-bit look thus creates an additional X-factor. The development in the Mercedes-Benz Vision One-Eleven reinforces the increasing fusion of physical and digital.",
            "Creating an experimental spatial user interface - augmented reality takes the user experience to a new level",
            "For the premiere of the Vision One-Eleven, Mercedes-Benz designers have created a visionary user experience with the aid of augmented reality (AR), setting it inside a virtual prototype of the Vision One-Eleven interior. As soon as the driver dons the Magic Leap 2 augmented reality headset, their experience is enriched with high-definition digital content that is contextually integrated into their surroundings. It creates a seamless spatial blend of physical interior and digital user interface beyond the screen. In effect, the entire car becomes the user interface.",
            "Mercedes-Benz has been exploring the benefits of AR since the launch of the F015 concept car in 2015. The AR UI in this new car presents a vision of the future that works on two levels: the information attached to the dashboard and information placed in the environment inside and outside the car. This marks the next step from screen-based UI with Mercedes-Benz intuitive zero-layer technology to an AR UI that arranges zero-layer elements around the user in space. Elements include modules, 3D icons and the navigation map. The control interface around the dashboard and steering wheel is also augmented with additional contextualised information attached to actual objects such as buttons or switches.",
            "The 180-degree AR view incorporates the world outside the virtual prototype - fusing the car effortlessly with its surroundings and placing the driver at the centre. Map elements are projected into the environment, which is enriched with further information such as places of interests or hidden hazards such as roadworks beyond a bend. With this X-ray view, the system enhances situational awareness by blending out unimportant details to create an uncluttered image of relevant input. Elements that obstruct the driver's line of sight - such as the A-pillar, doors or even the bonnet - then appear \"transparent\". Mercedes-Benz designers and experts worked with the technical specialists at Magic Leap to develop and refine the AR experience showcased in the Vision One-Eleven using the highly advanced Magic Leap 2 AR glasses.",
            "The spatial user interface is a beacon for a Mercedes-Benz user experience that is unencumbered by technology. It is part of a wider vision that looks towards extended reality, whereby technology and hardware cease to be the focal point; instead becoming fully integrated and seamless facilitators of user needs and wishes.",
            "Innovative electric powertrain - high-performance axial-flux motor and all-new battery technology",
            "Technology highlights include a new battery concept featuring high-performance liquid-cooled cylindrical cells with a novel cell chemistry. Once more, the extensive knowledge of the motorsport experts from Mercedes-AMG High Performance Powertrain in Brixworth found its way into this promising concept for future performance-oriented batteries. Aside from that, the Vision One-Eleven features two exceptionally powerful and advanced axial-flux motors from YASA. Mercedes-Benz is developing this technology together with YASA to large scale production maturity for its next-generation electric drives. YASA is a British electric-motor specialist based in Oxford and has been a 100-percent subsidiary of Mercedes-Benz AG since July 2021. The company has thus secured access to a unique future technology that has the potential to take electric mobility to a new level of performance.",
            "\"Axial-flux motors are significantly lighter and more compact, yet more powerful than comparable radial-flux motors currently used in 99 percent of all electric cars. In an axial-flux motor, the electromagnetic flow runs parallel to the motor's rotational axis, which is highly efficient. In a radial-flux motor, the flow runs perpendicular to the rotational axis. Compared to radial-flux motors, they have considerably higher and more enduring power reserves, which delivers a whole new level of performance.\" Tim Woolmer, Founder and Chief Technology Officer of YASA",
            "Alongside its power and torque density, another major benefit is the narrow package, which reduces both its weight and dimensions. The weight of an axial-flux motor is just one third of that of current electric motors with the same power output. At the same time, it requires just one-third of the space occupied by a radial-flux motor. This opens up completely new options for engineers as well as new freedoms in the design of an electric vehicle as demonstrated by the Vision One-Eleven.",
            "The future generation of YASA axial-flux motors will be produced at the Mercedes-Benz Berlin-Marienfelde plant. The motors manufactured there will be at the heart of the forthcoming powertrain for the performance segment."

From the front, the all-new GX continues the Lexus spindle body concept with an all-new bold, resolute design that also aids in off-roading functionality. To achieve the grounded, stable stance, designers created a taut body with a wide track and fender flares, pulling the front pillar base to the rear. The overall width increases by 3.74 inches (Overtrail by 4.52 inches) compared to the previous-generation GX. The Premium Triple Beam LED headlamps and grille opening have been raised to help avoid potential road impact. LED fog and cornering lamps are available for increased visibility. The front overhang has been decreased by 0.78 inches for improved clearance. The powerful front presence is led by the seamless grille and headlamp integration.",
            "From the side, the 2024 GX presents a solid, powerful presence featuring a horizontally flowing body with an increased wheelbase of 2.36 inches. The A-pillar has been pulled back for increased visibility in addition to the lower belt line and improved ground clearance. The overall length of the 2024 GX is increased by 2.75 inches. Contributing to the strong presence are the hard-to-miss 33-inch tires with 18-inch wheels on the Overtrail grades for optimal off-road performance. Rear tread is increased by 3.26 inches for Premium and Luxury grades and 4.06 inches for the Overtrail grades.",
            "At the back, the square, aggressive stance is continued with the signature unified L-shaped light bar. The updated LEXUS logo is a continuation of the Next Chapter design originally introduced on the 2022 NX. And, based on customer feedback, the all-new GX will feature a standard power rear lift door (GX first) with a pop-out window and an available kick sensor for hands-free convenience.",
            "The 2024 GX will be offered in 11 exterior color options depending on grade: Eminent White Pearl, Nebula Gray Pearl, Atomic Silver, GX-first Incognito, Caviar, Nori Green Pearl, Nightfall Mica. The Overtrail and Overtrail+ grades will offer exclusive bi-tone exterior color combinations including Atomic Silver/Black Roof, Incognito/Black Roof, Nori Green Pearl/Black Roof, and Lexus-first Earth/Black Roof.",
            "Lush Interior",
            "The all-new GX presents customers with the duality required of a luxury SUV - a rugged, capable exterior with the luxurious interior elements that help to create a road-trip oasis. No matter the length of the journey, drivers and passengers will reap the benefits of the modern and sophisticated interior. Featuring the driver-focused cockpit design also seen in the all-new RX, the all-new GX exhibits thoughtful elements that allow the driver the confidence to focus on the journey ahead.",
            "A substantial improvement on the last generation model is the all-new lower, horizontal instrument panel design that carries into the dash for a simplified front and passenger seat experience, providing excellent front and side visibility. It provides a clean, open space that seamlessly connects the available Head-Up Display (HUD) to the center where the standard 14-inch Multimedia Touchscreen Display with Lexus Interface technology can be found. Physical dials for frequently used controls such as air conditioning and audio volume remain, and all available off-road controls are concentrated near the gear shifter to help minimize potential driver distraction. The 2024 GX comes standard with a wireless Apple CarPlay® Integration and Android Auto® compatibility, as well as a digital 12.3 Multi-Information Display (MID).",
            "With seating for up to 7, the all-new GX incorporates thoughtful touches at every turn. Ergonomic measures have been implemented to help decrease load and work to aid driving posture through seat cushion, seatback bolster, and headrest improvements. The front seat hip point to heel height has been extended 1.18 inches.",
            "The second row is available in two configurations: captain's chairs or a 60:40 split-folding bench. A one-motion tumble system has been added for convenient access to the third row/luggage space. Heated and ventilated seats are standard in the driver and front passenger seats, with available heated second-row seats. The third row is available in both power and manual seat configurations. A rear seat reminder has been implemented for increased safety and convenience.",
            "The earth-tone focused interior color design is intended to complement the nature just outside the vehicle's doors. The 2024 GX is available in both a semi-aniline leather and NuLuxe® trimmed interior in Black, Dapple Gray, or Saddle Tan with black or dark brown grained trim. Overtrail grades are available in a GX-first color combination of Black NuLuxe® trimmed interior with Olive Ultrasuede accents or Chateau NuLuxe® trimmed interior with Olive Ultrasuede accents and black ornamentation.",
            "Six illuminated charging ports (four in Overtrail) are available throughout and a wireless charger is available in the front console tray to complete the tech-focused interior. And of course, interior storage space has been increased in the center console, door pockets and up to 12 cupholders. Luggage space for both the second and third row configurations has improved compared to the previous generation, holding up to 5 suitcases with the 3rd row folded. Two additional storage spaces have been added under the cargo area to accommodate smaller items, and a 120V AC inverter has been added for additional power needs.",
            "The 2024 GX comes standard with a 10-speaker premium surround sound system, with available 21- Speaker Mark Levinson Surround Sound. Additional options (depending on grade) include: Digital Key, Cool Box, Head-Up Display, Traffic Jam Assist, Cold Area Package and Tonneau Cover.",
            "GA-F Platform and Suspension",
            "The 2024 GX shares the GA-F platform introduced on the current-generation LX 600. This strong and lightweight ladder frame increases body rigidity and improved on-road handling, key elements of Lexus Driving Signature. A newly developed double-wishbone front suspension is paired with a multi-link rear suspension to achieve both a high level of off-road driving performance and on-road prowess. An available Adaptive Variable Suspension (AVS) constantly adjusts damping forces based on changing road conditions. GX adopts Electronic Power Steering (EPS) enabling increased steering feel on and off-road.",
            "Legendary Offroad Performance",
            "The GX has been known for its offroad prowess since the beginning, and the 2024 GX is no different. Standard Full-Time 4WD is adopted for consistent responsiveness in varied terrain with a Torsen® limited-slip center differential with locking feature. Overtrail grades add an electronic locking rear differential. When accelerating during a turn, the Torsen® differential optimally distributes the driving force according to the load on the rear left and right wheels to achieve a high level of controlled performance. In straight-line driving, it responds well to changes in road conditions, contributing to overall vehicle stability. Switching between 4hi and 4lo is now faster versus the previous generation due to enhancements on the electronic transfer case.",
            "Evolved Engine: 3.4-L Twin Turbo V6 and Direct Shift-10AT",
            "The all-new GX will be offered in two powertrain options to meet the needs of customers. At launch in the U.S., GX will come standard with a highly capable and efficient twin-turbocharged 3.4L V6 engine paired with a 10-speed Direct Shift Automatic Transmission. The twin-turbo V6 produces an improved 349 horsepower, outperforming the previous generation V8's 301 horsepower, and torque output also improves to a massive 479 lb.-ft. The twin turbochargers deliver steady and consistent acceleration to easily control power delivery in both on and off-road scenarios. Towing capacity has increased to 8,000 lbs. for Premium, Premium+ and Overtrail grades with the standard tow hitch.",
            "First-Ever Lexus OVERTRAIL Grade",
            "As expressed at the 2023 Tokyo Outdoor Show, Lexus has introduced the first-ever \"Overtrail Project,\" an initiative that intends to inspire customers around the world to explore nature through refined adventures. The goal is to include more opportunities for Lexus customers in the future, including potential products, accessories, gear and experiences. The all-new Overtrail grade falls under the umbrella of this initiative.",
            "Adding to an already tough and rugged exterior, the Overtrail and Overtrail+ models add a host of features and specialized styling. An eye-catching bi-tone exterior paint combination is available in Atomic Silver/Black Roof, Incognito/Black Roof, Nori Green Pearl/Black Roof, and Lexus-first Earth/Black Roof. The intention behind the color design was to create a cohesive relationship with the outdoors via calming earth tones that blend in with nature. Overtrail grades also feature standard 33-inch All-Terrain tires wrapped around 18-inch wheels, black accented overfenders and a standard aluminum skid plate.",
            "On the inside, the natural earth tones continue with Lexus-first Chateau with Olive Ultrasuede accents and a classic Black with Olive Ultrasuede accents for a luxurious touch. Overtrail+ grade will come standard with an exclusive seat design for optimal off-road comfort with available driver and front passenger massage seats and driver power cushion extender.",
            "Multi-Terrain Select (MTS), Crawl Control, Downhill Assist Control (DAC), and 3D Multi-Terrain Monitor systems are standard on GX Overtrail grades for optimal traction on the trails, along with an Electronic-Kinetic Dynamic Suspension System (E-KDSS) for improved wheel articulation.

            "Celebrating 75 years of Porsche sports cars, the storied marque revealed its newest concept car: the Mission X. As a design study, not offered for sale, with production to be decided in due time, the Mission X is a glimpse into what the sports car of the future could look like.",
            "\"The Porsche Mission X is a technology beacon for the sports car of the future. It picks up the torch of iconic sports cars of decades past: like the 959, the Carrera GT and the 918 Spyder before it, the Mission X provides critical impetus for the evolutionary development of future vehicle concepts,\" says Oliver Blume, Chairman of the Executive Board of Porsche AG. \"Daring to dream and dream cars are two sides of the same coin for us: Porsche has only remained Porsche by constantly changing.\"",
            "Michael Mauer, Head of Style Porsche, says: \"The Mission X is a clear commitment to the core of the brand. The continuing, enhanced expression of our brand and product identity is an important compass for us to navigate the development of our series-production models. The concept study symbolizes a symbiosis of unmistakable motorsport DNA with a luxurious overall impression.\"",
            "Measuring approximately 4.5 metres (177 inches long) and 2 meters (78.7 inches) wide, the Porsche Mission X concept study is a relatively compact hypercar. With a wheelbase of 2.73 metres (107.4 inches), it has the dimensions of the Carrera GT and 918 Spyder. For aerodynamic purposes, the concept car has staggered tires, with 20-inch wheels at the front and 21-inch wheels at the rear.",
            "Design: classic brand elements reinterpreted",
            "The Porsche Mission X represents the pinnacle of performance and modern luxury. At the same time, its sculpted form and muscular lines demonstrate that hypercars do not have to look aggressive. The low-slung body, which is less than 47.2 inches tall, is finished in Rocket Metallic - an elegant paint color specially designed for the concept study. Design elements in a carbon fiber are found below the beltline. These components have a satin finish and are therefore slightly colored, but their material structure remains recognizable.",
            "The wheels of the concept study feature elaborate details: the rear axle is fitted with almost transparent aero blades, which are designed like turbines for better cooling of the brakes.",
            "A lightweight glass dome with an exoskeleton made of carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) extends over both occupants. Le Mans-style doors are attached to the A-pillar and the roof; they open forwards and upwards. This type of door was previously used on the legendary Porsche 917 racing car. Another eye-catcher is the light signature: for the Mission X, the designers have reinterpreted the characteristic Porsche four-point graphic. The vertical base form of the headlights was inspired by historic racing cars such as the Porsche 906 and 908 and drawn well down towards the road. A high-tech support structure frames the LED light modules and presents the exposed narrow elements of daytime running lights and indicators. When activated, the light opens up like an eye blinking open. Fully illuminated, the headlights make a confident statement.",
            "The modernised Porsche crest makes its debut on the Mission X",
            "A full-length light unit that appears to float characterizes the rear of the Porsche Mission X. Transparent, illuminated Porsche lettering is a standout feature. The sculptural rear light emerges, as if suspended in the air, from a support structure and extends across the entire width of the vehicle in four segments. While charging, the 'E' of the Porsche lettering pulses.",
            "One special detail is the modernized Porsche crest, which makes its debut on the Mission X. Brushed precious metal, a three-dimensional honeycomb structure, a refreshed heraldic beast and more subtle gold color - on close inspection, these are the differences between the modernized Porsche crest and its immediate forerunner. With its cleaner and more state-of-the-art execution, the refined crest communicates the character of Porsche. On the Mission X, it is found on the hood and steering wheel as well as in monochrome form on the wheel centers.",
            "The driver focus can be seen in the asymmetry of the interior and its color concept. The two seats are colored differently. Apart from the leather pads in Andalusia Brown, the driver's seat is Kalahari Grey and forms a single unit of color with the center console and the dashboard. The passenger seat is in the contrasting Andalusia Brown shade. Beyond the CFRP seat shells, and their six-point seatbelts integrated into the monocoque, further motorsport parallels include the open-top steering wheel, which has mode switches and shift paddles. There are multiple cameras on board. Recording starts as soon as the driver presses the Record button (REC) on the multi-purpose controller.",
            "Another highlight is found on the passenger side, where there is a bayonet system embedded in the instrument panel to which a stopwatch module can be attached. For the Mission X, Porsche Design has created a special stopwatch module with an analogue and digital display. The clocks are designed for both racetrack and rally use and can display the lap times or vital data of the driver, among other information.",
            "Technical vision: top marks in power-to-weight ratio, downforce and charging performance",
            "Porsche exemplifies e-performance yet is also a pioneer in sustainable mobility. The concept study meets both objectives in full measure. If the Mission X goes into series production, then it should:",
            "The battery is installed centrally behind the vehicle's seats. This 'e-core layout' centers the mass in the car. As with a conventionally powered mid-engine car, this provides the basis for excellent agility.",
            "Predecessors: innovative super sports cars from Porsche",
            "The fastest series-production car of its time; first series-production Porsche to be made of carbon fiber, and the first road-legal vehicle to beat the seven-minute mark on the Nürburgring Nordschleife - the Porsche 959 (1985), Carrera GT (2003) and 918 Spyder (2013) were milestone models in the world of super sports cars. And that makes them the conceptual forerunners of the Mission X.",
            "In 1985, the Porsche 959 made its debut as a technology platform. Its 443 hp six-cylinder twin-turbo boxer engine, combined with an aerodynamically optimized body, propelled the super sports car to a top speed of 197 mph - then the world record for a series-production sports car.",
            "With its V10 engine and 605 hp, fierce design and, not least, its incomparable driving experience, the Porsche Carrera GT remains an icon among super sports cars to this day.",
            "Porsche hybrid technology reached a spectacular zenith with the 918 Spyder. In September 2013, the 887 hp two-seater was the first road-approved vehicle to crack the seven-minute barrier on the 12.8-mile Nürburgring Nordschleife, completing the lap in 6:57 minutes. Porsche aims to stay true to this standard of the highest e-performance: our vision, should the Mission X go into series production, is for it to be the fastest road-legal vehicle on the Nürburgring Nordschleife."

Limited to 100 units, this iconic limited series follows in the legendary footsteps of the GTA Le Mans, combining sophisticated aerodynamics with an incredible power-to-weight ratio, as did the Alpine M63, the first Alpine to compete at Le Mans in 1963. The A110 R Le Mans is the most radical A110 celebrating the most radical competition,\" explains Emmanuel Al Nawakil, VP, Alpine Sales, Network and Launching.",

It also incorporates a carbon wing evoking the endurance racing cars style and Alpine Elf Endurance Team's A480 design. Lightweight components, already used on the A110 R, contribute to its high level of performance with an acceleration time from 0 to 100kph of 3.9 seconds and a top speed of 285 kph on track.",
            "The Alpine A110 R Le Mans limited series comes with a Road & Track chock, an innovation patented by Alpine, which lowers and stiffens the car by 5% for even better stability on the track. This technical development, coupled with a specific suspension setting, enhances performance on the long Mulsanne straight and in the fast corners of the 24-Hours circuit.",
            "Ultra-sporty design expressing boldness and aerodynamics on the 24 Heures du Mans Circuit®",
            "The Alpine A110 R Le Mans is recognisable by its exclusive white and blue 24 Heures du Mans® livery. A thin double line of blue and white is applied to the front bonnet, roof and rear wing in a reference to racing, complemented by the blue fins. A blue piping strip distinguishes the carbon wheels, which are open at the rear for even greater braking endurance, whilst the shark fin on the carbon rear window is a reference to the A480 which competed in the 24 Hours of Le Mans®.",
            "This emblematic limited series receives the official 24 Hours of Le Mans® signature on the front spoilers, side sills and microfibre headrest pads of the Sabelt® Track bucket seats. In the ultimate nod to Le Mans, the layout of the 24 Hours circuit is subtly laser-engraved on the sun visor.",

            "As a small SUV that does big Volvo things, the new fully electric Volvo EX30 is designed to be as safe as you'd expect from us. It is designed to have the smallest CO2 footprint of any Volvo car to date, and to make people's lives safer, more convenient and more enjoyable through cutting-edge technology and Scandinavian design.",
            "Revealed to the world in Milan, Italy, the EX30 is Volvo's first small premium SUV and expands the constantly growing, all-electric offering to four models. As the market is rapidly moving towards full electrification, the EX30 will help us capture growing demand for fully electric cars in a fast-growing segment.",
            "What's more, the attractive pricing of the Volvo EX30 - which starts at around EUR 36,000 - means Volvo customers get a premium all-electric SUV for a similar price as an internal combustion engine-powered equivalent. The EX30 will also be available with Care by Volvo subscription package, with its set pricing and transparent ordering process, making ordering one a breeze.",
            "\"The fully electric EX30 might be our smallest ever SUV, but it's a big deal for our customers and a big deal for us as a company,\" said Jim Rowan, Volvo's chief executive. \"We like to say the EX30 is small yet mighty, because it delivers on everything you'd want from a Volvo but in a smaller package. Like any Volvo, it's an outstanding product which is safe and designed around people and their needs.\"",
            "The Volvo EX30 embodies all of Volvo design values in a smaller format. A long wheelbase, large wheels and equal overhangs bring balance and refinement to the exterior. It's distinctly electric, with a confident face, closed shield and a digital rendition of the Thor's Hammer headlights. Five vibrant exterior colours, from stylish Cloud Blue to bright and expressive Moss Yellow - the latter inspired by lichen growing on rocks along the Swedish west coast - give it character and personality.",
            "Battery tech that suits your needs",
            "First of all, there's no such thing as simply 'a battery' when we discuss powertrains. Instead, Volvo is giving you the freedom to choose the battery technology that best suits your needs, offering the EX30 with three powertrain options and two different battery types, which also allows us to offer an attractive entry price point for the EX30.",
            "If you spend most of your time in the city or tend to travel shorter distances between charges, Volvo is offering a single-motor option with an LFP battery. The LFP standard-range battery, which uses lithium iron phosphate chemistry, is more cost-effective and less resource-intensive to produce, meaning it is the best option if you don't need maximum range.",
            "If you prefer to maximise range, the Single Motor Extended Range variant with an NMC extended-range battery is your EX30 of choice. The NMC battery features lithium, nickel, manganese and cobalt, and produces its energy more efficiently than the LFP variant. This single-motor, extended range option gives you a range of up to 480km between charges.",
            "Finally, if performance is your priority, pick the Twin Motor Performance variant in which Volvo pair the NMC battery with an additional second e-motor. This all-wheel drive variant of the EX30 provides 315kW (428hp) and takes you from 0-100 km/h in 3.6 seconds - it's officially the fastest-accelerating Volvo ever!",
            "Another thing the Volvo EX30 does fast is charging. The extended-range Twin Motor variant has a charging capacity of up to 153kW, while the standard-range car has a capacity of 134kW. That means you can charge your battery from 10 to 80 per cent in a little over 25 minutes. Through the car's centre display and app, you can set the amperage, maximum charging level and when you want to start charging.",
            "To support the best possible driving experience, the chassis of the EX30 has been tuned to make the most of the car's compact dimensions. Its low centre of gravity, as well as its relatively low and evenly distributed weight are complemented by ease of driving and nimbleness in the city and beyond.",
            "A smaller carbon footprint, yet a big safety impact",
            "Volvo EX30 is designed to have the lowest carbon footprint of any Volvo car to date and represents an important step forward for the firm's sustainability ambitions. By tackling emissions across the entire production and lifecycle, as well as a considerate use of materials inside and out, Volvo managed to reduce its total carbon footprint over 200,000 kms of driving to below 30 tonnes.",
            "The EX30 is also designed to be as safe as you'd expect from a Volvo and aims to look after both you and others in hectic urban environments. For example, it includes as standard a special safety feature for bikes that helps to prevent so-called 'dooring' accidents, by alerting you when you are about to open your door in front of a cyclist, scooter or runner.",
            "The protective safety technology further illustrates how Volvo have applied high safety standards to their new small SUV. It contains state-of-the-art restraint technology, as well as top-notch structural design that fulfills the ambitious in-house safety requirements - designed to prepare Volvo cars for various real-world scenarios.",
            "The Volvo EX30 also aims to make your life more convenient, more relaxing and more enjoyable inside the car through cutting-edge tech and considerate Scandinavian interior design. You can choose from four distinct interior rooms, each with their own expression, while there are smart storage options throughout the cabin.",
            "Together with a contextual single-screen UX, with Google built-in and running the latest version of the infotainment system, these features all reflect the hallmarks of true Volvo design.",
            "Speaking of cutting-edge tech: the Volvo EX30 is the first car to include a new generation of Volvo's popular Park Pilot Assist feature. It can handle all types of parking spaces, including parallel, curved, perpendicular and diagonal fishbone-style, making parking in tight spaces a breeze.",
            "The new Park Pilot Assist will identify any available parking spots around you. Then, once you've tapped the one you want in the new 3D user interface, the feature will operate the throttle and brake as well as the steering. While you supervise the parking process, the screen shows the distance to objects such as cars, walls and bollards in metric or imperial figures.",
            "As with any Volvo car, for the EX30 the company worked closely with tech partners such as Google, Apple and Qualcomm to deliver the best possible user experience. Volvo have also worked closely with ECARX through the jointly owned HaleyTek software joint venture to deliver the best possible infotainment platform for the customers.",
            "A sense of calm",
            "Of course, the Volvo EX30 will also come with a digital key functionality which is both convenient for you and makes it easy to share the car with others. Built on the advanced UWB and CCC industry standards, the technology will be compatible with a wide range of phone brands and models.",
            "The car's dedicated app contains all relevant services related to the car, from charging to finding your car on a busy parking lot, locking it and heating it on a cold winter day. The EX30 is also prepared to receive software updates over the air that will make it better over time.",
            "As if that wasn't enough, the Volvo EX30 also comes with a choice of five different ambient lighting themes. Each is inspired by a different Scandinavian landscape and subtly shifting in colour, adding a sense of calm to the interior.",
            "Whether you prefer the warm sunlight falling through the leaves of a Scandinavian forest, a sunset on the Swedish west coast, the world famous northern lights, the golden summer skies of Swedish midsummer or the bright mood of an urban sunset, your EX30 will be filled with the colours of your choice. For extra immersion, you can pair each lighting theme with an ambient soundscape.",
            "Zooming across the country in style",
            "Starting in 2024, Volvo EX30 will also become available as a Cross Country variant. Order books for this special version of the small electric SUV will open in 2024, with production expected to start later that year.",
            "The Volvo EX30 Cross Country will build on the long Cross Country heritage, the celebrated line-up of models for customers who want a bit more adventure from their car. It'll come with a range of bespoke features, such as more ground clearance, 19-inch black wheels and the option of 18-inch wheels with bespoke tyres.",
            "When you take your EX30 Cross Country off the beaten path, it will be recognisable by its skidplates on the front, rear and side, special black panels on the front bumper and bootlid, and stylish Cross Country branding - the small, hood-mounted Swedish flag is the cherry on top."

            "From the moment it was introduced in 2016, the iconic sixth generation Camaro established itself as the leaner, meaner generation; culminating with the ZL1 1LE track athlete. Throughout the generation, Camaro featured a wide variety of special editions that ranged from charismatic with the 50th Anniversary and Wild Cherry Design Package to edgy with the Shock and Steel and Redline Edition. As the Gen Six Camaro retires at the conclusion of the 2024 model year, Chevrolet is celebrating the car's legacy of agility and style by offering a final special Collector's Edition on the LT/RS, LT1, SS and ZL1 trims in North America.",
            "The 2024 Camaro Collector's Edition resurfaces ties that date back to the development of the first-generation Camaro. Panther, the original code name for the program that became Camaro in the 1960s, provided inspiration for the Chevrolet Performance Design Studio's efforts to cement the sixth generation of the car in history.",
            "\"We found it fitting for this Collector's Edition Camaro to officially recognize the significance of the original code name and share it with Camaro enthusiasts,\" said Rich Scheer, design director, Chevrolet Performance. \"Of course, the name 'Panther' influenced the colors used, Panther Black Metallic for SS and Panther Matte Black for ZL1.\"",
            "The Collector's Edition equips LT/RS, LT1 and SS trims with a new Panther Black Metallic Tintcoat paint, Satin Black accent stripes, 20-inch Satin Black or optional Polished Forged Wheels, the front splitter from the 1LE package and coupes receive the rear spoiler from the ZL1 package.",
            "The 650 horsepower LT4-powered ZL1 Collector's Edition, limited to 350 units, will feature a Panther Black Matte exterior color - the first matte paint offered on Camaro from the factory. The ZL1 will also feature the front splitter from the ZL1 1LE, and the rear wing from ZL1 1LE on coupes. The Black Metallic ZL1 stripe, red brake calipers and black lug nuts complete the exterior look. On the inside, all 350 Collector's Edition ZL1 vehicles receive a serialized steering wheel badge representing where that vehicle was built in sequence.",
            "Across all builds, Camaro Collector's Editions receive unique front fender script badging that integrates a panther into the \"R,\" and a panther on the steering wheel badge. These Camaro builds also feature special floor mats with a laser-etched aluminum Collector's Edition logo and unique black interior treatments.",
            "Those who purchase a Camaro Collector's Edition will receive a welcome kit which contains two posters commemorating the Camaro generations and the Collector's Edition.",
            "Camaro ZL1 Collector's Edition owners will also receive a bespoke Canfield Sport 45mm watch from Shinola commemorating the Collector's Edition, with an inscribed serial number that matches the number on their vehicle's steering wheel badge. Thoughtfully crafted to carry the same ebonized presence as the 2024 Camaro Collector's Edition, this wearable keepsake hosts Camaro and panther motifs, from the panther engraved watch band to the Camaro logo housed on the watch face.",
            "\"Shinola is proud to share a legacy for quality, craftsmanship and performance with the Camaro nameplate, and we cherish the Detroit heritage that both Shinola and Chevrolet have,\" Shinola CEO Awenate Cobbina said."

            "Lexus has a proud history of pushing boundaries and challenging the status quo. Since its founding in 1989, it has repeatedly pioneered new thinking and new products that have changed people's perceptions and reshaped the luxury car market. It has constantly evolved the concept of what luxury means, not just by creating desirable and exciting products, but also by redefining the complete ownership experience.",
            "Its record of achievement today welcomes a new name: the Lexus LBX.",
            "The all-new, all-hybrid electric LBX is the smallest Lexus yet, but fully deserving of its status as a landmark model, one which breaks down the traditional luxury hierarchy and which will be a game-changer for the brand in Europe.",
            "LBX stands for Lexus Breakthrough Crossover, a compact SUV that will extend Lexus' brand appeal into new market territory. It embraces contemporary ideas in design and technology while maintaining the distinguishing Lexus qualities of the luxury craftsmanship and Omotenashi hospitality.",
            "This is a car that's simple, casual and easy to live with, but which makes no compromises in quality and attention to detail: the essence of Lexus has been distilled into a smaller package, transcending customers' traditional expectations of what a premium compact SUV can offer.",
            "It also breaks new ground by disrupting the traditional grade strategy to give owners more freedom to express their individual taste and sense of style. True to Lexus' commitment to \"making luxury personal,\" the LBX will be offered in a choice of four \"atmospheres\" in addition to its base grade. Rather than being defined by the level of equipment or comfort features, these atmospheres focus on expressing different refined, dynamic or sporty themes through styling details, colours, textures and finishes. A new Lexus Bespoke Build programme will offer yet more personalised options.",
            "The LBX is also a breakthrough for Lexus as a business in Europe. For the first time, Europe has been the lead global region for the development of a new Lexus vehicle. This influence will help the LBX become one of the best-sellers for the brand in Europe.",
            "The use of a three-letter name is significant - previously only the LFA supercar has enjoyed that distinction. The choice of the name LBX demonstrates Lexus' commitment to and trust in its new model. Just as the LFA showed a different side to the brand in terms of attitude and performance, so the LBX will in its own way expand its reach and profile.",
            "As a new entry point to Lexus' well-established SUV line-up, it offers strong appeal to a younger audience and those who may not have considered a Lexus before. It will be an attractive proposition to those seeking to downsize or purchase a second vehicle, meeting their new lifestyle requirements.",
            "Chief Engineer Kunihiko Endoh comments: \"Our aim was to challenge the conventional concept of a luxury car. We have thoroughly pursued a driving experience that enables a natural dialogue between the driver and their vehicle and a design that has an refined presence.\"",
            "The Lexus LBX's styling establishes a new Lexus identity with a \"Resolute Look\" front design that reinterprets the famous spindle grille. While the exterior dimensions are more compact than any other Lexus, the look is muscular and powerful. Inside, the emphasis is on driver-engagement with a focused driver's cockpit based on Lexus' Tazuna concept, and on creating a light, open feel with excellent visibility and an instrument panel that wraps around smoothly into the door panels.",
            "In doing things differently with the LBX, Lexus has taken a new approach to building a model range, introducing choices that better reflect how today's customers seek cars that match their personal style and character.",
            "Following its world debut, the LBX will go into production in late 2023. Sales will begin in European and selected global markets from early 2024.",
            "EXTERIOR DESIGN: A NEW LEXUS IDENTITY",
            "Lexus' design ambition was to create a car that is more relaxed than formal in character, displaying an authentic, effortless style that people will instantly feel a connection with.",
            "The most significant aspect of the design is a new frontal arrangement that \"breaks\" the spindle grille - a design hallmark for the past decade - leading Lexus into a new era.",
            "Koichi Suga, General Manager Lexus Design, explains: \"We have 'deconstructed' the spindle grille to make way for a new design. We've succeeded in creating a new front face identity that's completely different from before yet is instantly recognisable as a Lexus.\"",
            "The grille has been unified in a single trapezoid shape, positioned below a narrow aperture that runs beneath the leading edge of the bonnet, linking the slim headlight units. The design draws on the heritage of Lexus' \"Resolute Look.\" Introduced with the LF-S concept car of 2003, this became a signature styling cue for Lexus production models from the early 2000s.",
            "The seamless, frameless grille generates the lines of the Lexus LBX's spindle body, contributing to the car's strong, dynamic stance. It is also aerodynamically efficient, helping smooth airflow over and around the car. The new headlight design creates a strong visual signature, with the daytime running lights and turn indicators integrated in bi-functional units. With this new arrangement, the lights' distinctive L-shape has been changed to face out rather than inwards, to match the direction of each indicator light.",
            "Following the principles of Lexus Next Chapter Design, the car's identity and proportions are rooted in the driving experience it delivers. The front pillars have been pulled back, making the cabin appear compact and the bonnet longer for a sporty profile. The flared wings express power and accentuate the large (18-inch) wheels and tyres, while short overhangs and a bold tightening of the area around the rear doors evoke nimble, dynamic performance.",
            "The rear of the car also projects a strong stance. The licence plate has been moved down to the bumper so that the LEXUS lettered signature on the back door is more prominent on the clean expanse of the back door. Similarly, the latest evolution of the Lexus signature L-shaped light bar has greater visual impact, with the turn signal and reversing lamps having a subdued presence when not illuminated.",
            "The Lexus LBX is 4,190 mm long, 1,825 mm wide and 1,545 mm high and has a 2,580 mm wheelbase. The low-slung bonnet, belt mouldings flush with the body, a gate-style rear roof spoiler and precise light cluster designs enhance aerodynamic performance and contribute to the LBX's efficiency, stability and responsive performance.",
            "The exterior colour choices include vivid shades and Lexus' deep-lustre sonic finishes. Emotion and Cool versions of the LBX can be specified with bi-tone paintwork, combining any colour option with a contrast black roof.",
            "DYNAMIC PERFORMANCE: A NEW LEXUS PLATFORM",
            "The LBX is the first Lexus model to be constructed on a variation of the GA-B small car global architecture platform. It has been fundamentally adjusted to meet Lexus requirements, giving it the core benefits of a low centre of gravity, wide tracks, short overhangs and a highly rigid body. It is also the foundation of the car's fun-to-drive character, helping secure the Lexus Driving Signature in the smallest package yet. This helps create a natural dialogue between driver and car that ensures confidence, control and comfort at all times.",
            "Chief Engineer Endoh explains: \"To realise the Lexus sense of being at one with the car, we worked to achieve nimble driving that maximises the benefits of the car's small size and light weight. At the same time, we focused more than ever on honing the fundamental characteristics without relying on electronic controls.\"",
            "The body is strengthened with structural adhesives and short-pitch welding, and strategic placing of bracing and reinforcements. At the same time, vehicle weight has been kept down by the use of lightweight materials, including an aluminium bonnet and moulded resin wheel arches, rockers and lower door sections. Strong yet light hot-stamped materials are used in the centre pillars and bumper reinforcement.",
            "Setting the hip-point as low as 285 mm helps make the driver feel more at one with their vehicle, while maintaining an excellent view from the wheel, particularly when driving in city traffic.",
            "Front and rear suspension systems are designed for high rigidity and light weight, giving the Lexus LBX agile, stable cornering and steering response with smooth ride comfort. All versions feature a MacPherson strut design at the front; front-wheel drive models use a rear torsion beam while the all-wheel drive LBX has a double-wishbone arrangement.",
            "The electronically controlled braking system includes Vehicle Braking Posture Control. This automatically balances front and rear brake force distribution to suppress pitching and maintain linear, reassuring performance. It also helps reduce vehicle roll when cornering, keeping the car comfortable and stable and filtering out vibrations.",
            "POWERTRAIN: A NEW GENERATION OF LEXUS HYBRID DRIVE",
            "The LBX is powered by a new generation, self-charging Lexus hybrid electric system featuring a compact and lightweight 1.5-litre three-cylinder engine. The principal hybrid system components have undergone a substantial redesign, including the transaxle and power control unit, to improve efficiency, reduce losses, save weight and reduce size. There is also a new low resistance, high output, bi-polar nickel-metal hydride (NiMH) battery which enables extra electric motor support when accelerating and extends the car's all-electric EV driving capability.",
            "The technology developments have allowed Lexus to focus on more rewarding performance and a level of driving pleasure that was not possible with previous systems. Maximum output from the full hybrid system is 136 DIN hp/ 100 kW with peak torque of 185 Nm.",
            "The engine operates with world-class thermal efficiency, supported by high-speed combustion technology and design features such as straight intake ports and laser-clad intake valve seats. Other key features include ultra-lightweight pistons engineered for operation at high rpm and electronic intelligent variable valve-timing.",
            "The powertrain also features a newly designed transaxle. The revised power control unit is mounted directly above the transaxle, a design which helps give the LBX a low bonnet line. Further space is saved by the two motor-generators being located on separate shafts, reducing the drivetrain's overall length.",
            "The NiMH battery is an all-new bi-polar unit with reduced weight and a more compact design, yet it delivers higher output with much quicker response. Thus, it contributes to the LBX's performance with instant, powerful acceleration like that of battery electric vehicle, as well as its fuel efficiency. It benefits from a redesigned cooling system to help prolong battery life and performance.",
            "The powertrain is tuned for enjoyable performance, whether driving around town or on winding country roads, with faithful handling and a linear acceleration feel that is more closely aligned to the driver's use of the accelerator pedal. Drivability is also enhanced by Hybrid System Control that closely matches engine sound and acceleration. Thanks to the hybrid system upgrades, all-electric EV driving can be enjoyed at higher speeds and over longer distances, maximising the LBX's efficiency.",
            "The LBX's authentic SUV quality includes the option of Lexus' E-Four all-wheel drive, which introduces an additional electric motor on the rear axle. When pulling away, cornering and driving on low-grip surfaces, the system automatically directs drive force to the rear wheels, helping keep the vehicle stable and maintaining driver confidence.",
            "The LBX's luxury status is witnessed by the lengths Lexus has gone to manage noise and vibration (NVH). These include adding a balancer shaft to the engine to reduce vibration that can generate a booming effect in the cabin. Special attention has been paid to the doors where damping sheets have been introduced to suppress high frequency noise but enhance low frequency noise to give a distinct and pleasing sound. To counter vibration and road noise from the roof, high-damping mastic has been used together with an extensive silencer made of a highly effective insulating material. Other measures include a seal around the entire edge of the bonnet and noise insulating and absorbing sheets, liners, mouldings and foam in key areas throughout the car. Beneath the vehicle, high-damping and structural adhesives play their part in reducing noise and vibration, while also contributing the car's overall rigidity.",
            "INTERIOR DESIGN: SIMPLICITY AND ELEGANCE, CRAFTSMANSHIP AND HIGH QUALITY",
            "Lexus designers sought to create a simple and refined interior that creates the feel and atmosphere of a higher segment model. This effect is founded on three key elements: good visibility with an open view out and a simple, smooth instrument panel; the sense of wide interior space; and a centre console with a commanding presence.",
            "The premium quality and attention to detail is witnessed in a choice of upholsteries and trims with strong visual and tactile appeal. As well as top-quality semi-aniline leather, the options include a vegan-friendly interior that uses synthetic leather and materials for the seat coverings and steering wheel, shift lever and door trims. The LBX also features new Tsuyusami charcoal trim inlays, created using a new film technique that uses multiple layers to give a highly textured appearance with a sense of depth. Ambient lighting adds to the Omotenashi effect of people being made welcome and feeling completely at home in the vehicle. Highlighting different parts of the cabin, the lighting design provides a range of 50 colour options, curated in themes that evoke different moods.",
            "The driver's cockpit is an interpretation of Lexus' Tazuna concept, first introduced on the NX mid-size SUV. This positions principal controls and information sources immediately around the driver, so their operation only requires minimal movements of hand or eye. This helps keep the driver focused on the task of driving, with least distraction. The position and angle of the steering wheel were precisely calculated to give the driver a rewarding sense of control.",
            "Here, the Tazuna concept is enhanced with a new, 12.3-inch fully digital instrument display, featured in a Lexus for the first time. The lay-out and prominence of the meters and data change according to the drive mode selected and can be customised to suit individual preferences. An optional head-up display is also available.",
            "Thanks to the Lexus LBX's compact size, almost every inch of the car can be seen from the steering wheel, adding to the confidence, comfort and control the driver enjoys with the Lexus Driving Signature. The contouring of the bonnet and the shape and position of the front pillars reduce the blind sports and give an extended downward view that helps the driver steer more precise lines.",
            "To help maintain a wide, clear view, the horizontal instrument panel has a clean and simple design. At each side, its form flows into the door panel, giving a sense of wrapping around the front seat occupants, so the feel is expansive yet encompassing. The continuous line created by this design also helps the driver sense the degree of vehicle roll when driving through bends. A low hip-point adds to the driver's sense of being at one with their car, while ample front knee-space is provided. To ensure a good view out for everyone on board, the rear seats are set slightly higher than those at the front.",
            "The centre console has a strong presence with the large multimedia touchscreen tilted back so that it integrates smoothly with the structure. The unit has upholstered side pads and houses two cupholders and multiple storage points and USB ports for device connection and charging. The load compartment offers up to 332 litres (FWD models with rear seats in place) of space - room enough for two 75-litre cases to be carried beneath the folding tonneau cover.",
            "MULTIMEDIA AND INFOTAINMENT",
            "The LBX is equipped with the latest Lexus Link Connect system, operated via a 9.8-inch touchscreen.",
            "The system provides cloud-based navigation, optimising journey planning with real-time information on traffic events and delays. Further convenience is provided by the \"Hey Lexus\" on-board assistant which responds to voice commands from both driver and front seat passenger.",
            "Smartphone integration is enabled using wireless or wired connections for Apple CarPlay, or a wired link for Android Auto. Further convenience is provided by an optional digital key. Compatible with both Apple and Android smartphones devices, this allows owners to use their smartphone to unlock and start their car. They don't have to take their phone out of their pocket or bag, just having it on their person is sufficient. They can also share the digital key when other people need to access or use the vehicle.",
            "In common with the latest new Lexus models, the LBX offers seamless over-the-air software updates for its multimedia and safety systems, so owners can benefit from upgrades without having to organise a visit to a Lexus workshop.",
            "Mark Levinson, Lexus' exclusive audio partner, has designed an optional premium system for the car, featuring an array of 13 optimally positioned speakers. They include a subwoofer integrated in the back door, avoiding any loss of space in the load compartment.",
            "MODEL RANGE: INTRODUCING LBX ATMOSPHERES",
            "With the LBX, Lexus is taking a new approach to building a model range, to better match customers' preferences and lifestyles.",
            "The line-up offers a choice of four model \"atmospheres\" in addition to the base grade: Elegant and Relax which focus on a refined feel, and Emotion and Cool which have a sportier, more dynamic character. Each has been designed with a different type of customer in mind.",
            "Emotion and Cool models stand out with bi-tone paintwork and 18-inch alloy wheels with a machined finish. The Elegant and Relax versions have a monotone exterior paint finish and glossy 18-inch alloys.",
            "Where the interior specifications are concerned, the Emotion model comes with perforated synthetic leather upholstery with red accents and contrast stitching on the seats, centre console and door trim. The LBX Cool - the top dynamic-themed model - has an Ultrasuede and leather bi-tone black/dark grey interior with copper details and stitching.",
            "Different moods are evoked by the Elegant and Relax atmospheres. Synthetic leather in a subtle Forest Brown shade or Ammonite Sand features in the LBX Elegant, for the door panels, instrument panel and console pads as well as the seat upholstery. For the Relax model, the choice is Saddle Tan or Black semi-aniline leather with distinctive Tatami stitching.",
            "In addition to the four atmosphere models there is an entry level LBX which, comes with advanced technology features as standard rather than extra-cost options, in contrast to some competitor models. Notably these include the extensive active safety and driver assistance systems included in the latest generation Lexus Safety System +. The entry model and the Emotion and Elegant versions can be specified with a vegan-friendly interior with no leather products.",
            "Equipment option highlights include a 12.3-inch Tazuna concept digital instrument display, head-up display, remote parking, digital key, Mark Levinson premium surround sound audio, Panasonic's nanoe™-X air purification technology and a power back door.",
            "Lexus Bespoke Build",
            "Owners who wish to give their LBX a more personalised look can take advantage of the new Lexus Bespoke Build service. Lexus' customer-first approach gives them the freedom to personalise their vehicle with tailor-made details.",
            "The bespoke treatment allows customers to change the colour of the seatbelts and the upholstery embroidery patterns and stitching colour and the trim ornamentation. The choice of luxury materials includes L-aniline leather - a prestige leather only available on LBX and the flagship LS sedan within the Lexus range - and Ultrasuede in different colour combinations. This personalisation service will be introduced in selected markets after the start of LBX sales in 2024.",
            "SAFETY AND DRIVER ASSISTANCE",
            "The Lexus LBX benefits from the comprehensive safety and driver assistance provisions of the latest generation of Lexus Safety System +. This equips the car with multiple systems to detect accident risks, alert the driver and automatically provide steering, braking and drive force control if required to help avoid or lessen the consequences of a collision. Key elements include a Pre-Collision System with Intersection Turn Assist, Dynamic Radar Cruise Control, Lane Tracing Assist/Lane Keep Assist and Road Sign Assist. Additional items that support safer driving and manoeuvring and reduce the burden on the driver include Lexus' e-latch electric door release system with Safe Exit Assist, a driver monitor, intelligent parking sensors with auto-braking, Rear Cross Traffic Alert and a Blind Spot Monitor.",
            "An extended safety will be optionally available, introducing features such as a Front Cross Traffic Alert system and a Panoramic View Monitor. A remote parking option can take all the stress out of manoeuvring the car into a tight space; it even allows the driver to park their vehicle remotely, using their smartphone.",
            "The driver enjoys better visibility in poor weather conditions with a new wet arm wiper, as featured previously on Lexus' flagship LC and LS models. This distributes washer fluid from the wiper itself, giving more thorough and immediate windscreen cleaning performance.",

            "Volkswagen of America, Inc. unveiled the three-row ID. Buzz in Huntington Beach, California. Paying homage to the iconic Volkswagen Microbus, the three-row ID. Buzz has been tailored specifically for North America. It offers a longer wheelbase than the two-row European vehicle that debuted in 2022, plus a bigger battery and more horsepower. Retro design cues-like the oversized VW logo, short overhangs, and available two-tone color palette-meet a tailored interior, cutting-edge EV technology, and advanced driver assistance features, clearly marking it as a vehicle of the future. The three-row ID. Buzz is planned for sale in the North American market starting in 2024.",
            "\"The zero-direct emission ID. Buzz is the spiritual reincarnation of the Microbus, reimagined for our electric future,\" said Pablo Di Si, President and CEO of Volkswagen of America, Inc. \"It is practical, sustainable, and packaged in an unmistakably fun way that is classic Volkswagen. With its launch, the Bus will once again become our brand hero in America.\"",
            "Just as with the original Bus, the three-row ID. Buzz has a rear-mounted powerplant as standard, providing great traction, performance and agility. The rear motor produces 282 horsepower, in comparison to the two-row European-spec model, which debuted with 201 hp. The battery is also larger at 91 kWh (gross), compared with the two-row model's 82 kWh battery. The efficient skateboard design-with the battery mounted in the floor-not only saves space, but also contributes to better handling by locating a large percentage of the vehicle's weight low down in the structure. All-wheel drive is available for the three-row ID. Buzz at launch, with about 330 hp and dual motors. Like all current modular electric drive (MEB) vehicles, the Buzz uses a multi-link rear suspension and struts at the front.",
            "The new APP550 rear-mounted motor is a PMS (permanent magnet synchronous) design with a maximum torque of 406 pound-feet, packaged with the one-speed transmission and a new inverter (power and control electronics). The increase in power, torque and efficiency is achieved by a rotor with stronger permanent magnets that have a high thermal load capacity, a newly developed stator with a larger effective number of turns and maximum wire cross-section, a water cooling jacket for the outside of the stator, and a combined oil and water cooling system that also ensures higher thermal stability. The new electric motor of the ID. Buzz increases the top speed to an electronically limited 99 mph, up from the two-row's 90 mph.",
            "Outside, the ID. Buzz retains its traditionally boxy shape with short overhangs, giving it maximum utility on a minimal footprint. It is 192.4 inches in length, nearly 10 inches longer than the two-row Buzz; all that additional length comes from a 127.5-inch wheelbase, versus 117.6 inches for the two-row. It is 77.9 inches wide and 74.6 inches tall, making it roughly as wide as an Atlas, but five inches taller. Given that the original Bus was about as long as a 2019 Beetle and slightly narrower, this is a sizable increase. The coefficient of drag is just 0.29-very good for a vehicle of this shape.",
            "Retro cues throughout are a throwback to the original Bus, while reinterpreting the design for the future. The iconic oversized VW logo is illuminated, with a light line that extends to either side, connecting to the LED headlights. Bold exterior colors, with an available two-tone color palette, include many found on the two-row ID. Buzz-Energetic Orange, Pomelo Yellow and Mahi Green, for example. Others, such as Cabana Blue, Metro Silver, and Indium Grey, are all-new.",
            "Dual power-sliding rear doors with Easy Open and Close provide excellent access to the third row and are replete with a modern take on the classic sliding windows-also fully powered. The Buzz also features standard power-folding and heated side mirrors, plus a standard power tailgate with Easy Open and Close. This features allows owners to approach the vehicle with keys in a pocket or purse, and kick a foot under the rear bumper to either open or close the tailgate as needed. Proximity unlocking and keyless entry with illuminated door handles on the front makes ingress easy. On the D-pillar, air \"vents\" recall the original Bus's rear-engine cooling slots. The aerodynamically optimized 20-inch wheels are a full four inches larger in diameter than a 1950 T2 model's.",
            "Inside, attention has been paid to every detail-from the retro-inspired wood-optic dash to the whimsical Play and Pause pedals from the 2016 BUZZ concept, to Buzz easter eggs scattered throughout the vehicle. The removable center console includes flexible storage on top, with two unique dividers that double as a bottle opener and ice scraper, as well as two additional compartments below.",
            "Three interior color and trim choices are available. A dark brown and black combination includes dark brown leatherette seats with white piping, blue door inserts and a dark wood-look dash, paired with black headliner and décor pieces. A light grey and clay combination pairs light grey leatherette seats with clay-colored piping, clay door inserts, a light wood-look dash, and light grey décor pieces. The final combination gives a balanced modern look with light brown leatherette seats with yellow piping, light grey door inserts and a washed wood-look dash, paired with black.",
            "Ambient lighting with 30 colors is standard, and allows drivers to select from five preset moods, or choose to different areas individually. The wide-open greenhouse can be further enhanced by an available panoramic glass sunroof with electrochromic tinting, which changes from clear to opaque with the swipe of a finger.",
            "This sunroof is 67.4 inches long and 40.8 inches wide, making this the largest of any in the Volkswagen Group. The roof works through a PDLC (polymer-dispersed liquid crystal) layer integrated into the glass. Current is applied to the crystals in this layer to create transparency, with opacity happening when the PDLC layer is de-energized. Additional coating in the glass helps to reflect sunlight to help reduce the heat that could enter the vehicle.",
            "Comfort reigns supreme in the ID. Buzz. The high seating position gives drivers supreme visibility. In addition to full perforated leatherette seating, all Buzz models are equipped with standard 12-way power driver and passenger seats with dual armrests, ventilation, massage, and memory functions; front seats and outboard second-row seats are heated. Standard Climatronic® automatic climate control keeps the cabin comfortable no matter the season, and all three rows have dedicated air vents. Second- and third-row windows are tinted for privacy, helping to maintain the interior temperature. The second-row seats can be folded down in a 60:40 split and the seat backs can be raked by 16 degrees. In addition, the bench can be moved fore and aft by up to 7.9 inches, and it can be moved forward by 4 inches at the touch of a handle to allow for better third-row egress.",
            "When temperatures drop outside, the standard heated steering wheel keeps drivers cozy; heated windshield washer nozzles are standard and a heated windshield is also available, all helping to maximize efficiency. Seating for seven is standard, and captain's chairs are available, with seating for six. The second and third rows fold flat, and the third row can be removed entirely. An available Flexboard, with two fabric storage bins, creates a flat floor with the seats folded. The available Harman Kardon premium audio system with 14 speakers will amplify any listening experience; nine speakers are standard.",
            "Modern technology in the ID. Buzz offers a fully connected experience. In the cockpit, drivers are presented with two screens: the 5.3-inch ID. Cockpit, which sits behind the steering wheel with key information, and the 12.9-inch central infotainment display. The Buzz makes it easier than ever to connect compatible devices with standard wireless App-Connect, wireless charging, plus eight USB-C ports throughout the vehicle, a 110V outlet under the passenger seat, and 12-volt charging in the cargo area.",
            "The infotainment system has been upgraded in line with the upcoming ID.7 sedan. The touch sliders for volume and temperature have been illuminated. The infotainment screen now has the climate functions integrated in the bottom of the display, allowing immediate access to these functions.",
            "Operation has become simpler, more intuitive and more customizable. The top bar of the display now has a new direct access function on the left, which opens the main menu with an overview of all apps with just one click. Next to it is a button for the new Car Control Center, which offers direct access to the most important vehicle functions, which can be configured individually. The main menu and the Car Control Center can be opened at any time without having to exit the active app. This significantly simplifies operation. The new home screen in the middle combines the content of the most important apps on tiles of different sizes. In addition to classic content such as navigation and radio/media, the tiles also offer new functions such as suggestions from the voice assistant. The home screen can also be individually configured by the user.",
            "The Buzz also comes with the ID. Light system-a light strip that runs below the windshield and provides the driver with intuitive support. It uses various light pulses to signal status such as readiness to drive, turn instructions from the navigation system, brake prompts from driver-assistance systems, and incoming phone calls. When using voice commands, it signals that it is listening, similar to voice-activation on mobile phones or virtual assistants. When the ID. Buzz is plugged in to charge, the ID. Light indicates the current level of charge.",
            "IQ.DRIVE® driver assistance technology, featuring hands-on Level 2 ready capability, is standard in the ID. Buzz. On the highway, IQ.DRIVE features lane centering and a capacitive steering wheel to help make driving easier. Around town, IQ.DRIVE helps alert you to obstacles in front of you, and keeps an eye around you to help make driving safer.
