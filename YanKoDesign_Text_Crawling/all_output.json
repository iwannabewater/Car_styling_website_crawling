            "The Goodwood Festival of Speed saw nature’s fury abruptly cancel the event in West Sussex during the latter half, but some major highlights left a lasting impression on the estate of the Duke of Richmond. Porsche celebrates its 75th anniversary this year and the speed festival saw an installation that revers in the German marque’s success.",
            "The speed festival also marks its 30th anniversary, and for this double dose of celebration, British artist Gerry Judah designed a jaw-dropping sculpture of the classic Porsche sportscars and road cars that have made an appearance at the event all these years and are pivotal in the brand’s soaring success. The colossal sculpture has six branching arms each displaying the racing cars that are important milestones in their 75 years of success.",
            "Designer: Gerry Judah",
            "This steel structure has a dodecahedral center with looping hoops leading to the six arms representing the line of speed eventually leading to the cars. According to Judah the inspiration for this marvel comes from the craving to make “a sculpture that would be celebratory.” He believes the installation is like, “setting off fireworks to enhance the joy of peace.” The sculpture is positioned in front of the Goodwood house as the festival’s center feature, just like all these years.",
            "Judah in the past has created artistic sculptures including the 31-metre-high looping structure showcasing the Aston Martin DBRI car and one in celebration of race-car driver Bernie Ecclestone, but this one is special in its own rights. The gargantuan figure stands 28 meters tall at its highest point and 26 meters wide. To support the frame and the weight of the precious Porsche’s fighting against gravity, the structure is crafted from 40 tonnes of steel and supported by a 290-tonne concrete base.",
            "The longest arm holds the single-seater Porsche 718 Formula 2 sportscar (making a successful debut in the 1960 Formula 2 season) to represent all the future racing endeavors for Porsche. Under this speedster is the Porsche 963 suspended in the celebratory livery and the gravity-defying Blaupunkt liveried Porsche 962 powered by a turbocharged flat-six engine is spiked adjacent to it. The Porsche 911 series is represented by the 992 Carrera introduced in 2018 and the 997.2 Sports Classic with the ducktail spoiler.",
            "It’s coated in white just like other sculptures made by Judah because he believes the color tends to enhance the overall shape and exemplify the details. The oldest of them all, the Porsche 365 (manufactured between 1948-1965) is suspended closest to the ground."

        "segments": [
            "Meet the Flying Brick, a car that’s just about as badass as Peaky Blinders’ protagonist, a certain Thomas Shelby. With its dominating hot-rod demeanor, reinforced by visible exhausts, gnarly front bumpers, and a carbon-fiber body, this mafioso’s town car was actually designed for Russian billionaire and avid drift-master Sergei Kabargin. The name Flying Brick comes from the symbol of resistance and the role bricks have played in populist uprisings, and sort of fits well into the car’s overall aesthetic, with its square-ish shape and the fact that the engine outputs a mind-numbing 900 horsepower!",
            "Designer: Alexander Opanasenko for Sergei Kabargin",
            "The Flying Brick comes 7 years in the making, from a mere napkin sketch to actual reality. Kabargin recruited his own team to build out his one-off hot rod fantasy, getting senior car designer Alexander Opanasenko on board to help fine-tune the design and build the renders we see here. The car’s references come from a variety of places, and it’s really difficult to pin-point the aesthetic language Kabargin and team were going for with this, but their brief was pretty simple – “the car must have its own character and personality.”",
            "The body of the car is based on a monocoque made of aluminum and carbon fiber, clocking in at 1200 kilograms (2645 lbs), and will be outfitted with a MAST LS7 supercharged engine capable of 900 horsepower. The car’s overall body adds to the theme of dominance with aggressive surfacing that exposes the car’s elements like superchargers that pop out of the hood, and exhausts emerging from the front quite typical of hot rods.",
            "There’s a fair amount of retrofuturism with the Flying Brick – starting with its interplay between the vintage aesthetic and the use of carbon fiber. The car’s details are decidedly antique-inspired, but the headlights are quite certainly modern. There’s also a unique interplay between luxury and brutish aggression, which ties in wonderfully with the Shelby theme Kabargin and team were going for. I doubt if Tommy would particularly care about the exaggerated front bumper or the somewhat out-of-place spoiler on the rear, but that boot looks big enough to store your entire weapon arsenal… or perhaps a few unlucky suspects and victims!",
            "Kabargin and team are apparently hard at work, realizing the Flying Brick as a one-off automobile. It’s unclear what the car’s timelines are, what its interiors look like, and how its performance stacks up, but given Kabargin’s enthusiasm for sitting behind the wheel, we can rest assured that this hot rod isn’t going to spend most of its time in a garage!"

            "Folding to a fraction of its size in just 5 steps, the Advance Flex from Pure Electric affirms the dream of last-mile commutes. It’s small enough to fit under your desk or in the boot of your car, weighs a mere 16kg (35 lb), and packs a 710W motor, powerful enough to get you from A to B in a city regardless of the terrain or the weather condition.",
            "The Advance Flex fulfills the lofty position of being a no-compromise electric commute solution. It’s foldable, portable, powerful, comfortable, and lets you easily weave through roads and sidewalks to get you to your destination in time, often even outshining cars and motorcycles, that may hit higher speeds, but succumb to traffic lights and urban gridlock.",
            "Designer: Pure Electric",
            "For Pure Electric, the Advance Flex ushers in a new era for e-scooters with a forward-stance design. Most e-scooters have a slim standing platform that requires you to stand with one foot at the front and another at the back, but the Advance Flex shakes things up with two dedicated footrests that give you a natural stance with your feet side by side, allowing you to feel more confident while riding and be much more in control. Calling this the “Forward Stance”, the company highlights the important role it plays in just being able to easily hop on or off, and to maneuver the scooter without feeling like you’ll fall over. The side-by-side stance keeps your center of gravity right between your feet, helping you maintain equilibrium as you cruise down city roads.",
            "Speaking of cruising down roads, the Advance Flex’s built-in motor offers 710W of peak power, allowing it to hit the certified maximum speed of 15.5 mph or 25 km/h with ease, while even providing enough torque to drive you uphill too. A 36V / 9.5Ah battery gives the scooter a range of up to 24.8 miles, while the Advance Flex offers 3 driving modes to choose from, letting you prioritize speed over range. An integrated headlight and taillight help you navigate your environment in the dark, and indicators built into each footrest also let people know when you’re turning, establishing rider intent and preventing mishaps.",
            "The 5-step folding design is perhaps the Advance Flex’s biggest user-friendly feature, making it ridiculously compact to carry when not in use. The handlebar has a telescopic collapsible design, while a hinge above the front wheel, and another main hinge right down the middle of the bike’s horizontal member allow it to fold further into a compact form small enough to stow underneath a desk or even in the boot of your car. The last two folding elements (the footrests) complete the closing technique, while the Advance Flex’s kickstand allows the scooter to still hold its vertical stance even when folded. In its folded format, the e-scooter measures a mere 24.4 inches in length, 22.4 inches tall, and 11.8 inches wide. Open it out and the resulting full-size e-scooter measures 41 inches long, stands tall at 42.5 inches, and measures 23.6 inches wide.",
            "The two foldable footrests give the Advance Flex its “Forward Stance”",
            "Designed for modern, urban use, the Pure Electric Advance Flex comes with a few nifty features that make riding safe, intuitive, and backed by innovation. The Advance Flex is IP65 dust and water-resistant and comes with tubeless tires and an entirely repairable design. It has 3 speed modes along with a cruise-control setting and Pure Control™ Steering Stabilisation for reliable driving. A smartphone app also lets you access your e-scooter’s added features, checking battery level and even scooter maintenance stats. Aside from being able to pretty much stash your scooter anywhere including the boot of your car, the Pure Electric app also lets you digitally lock your e-scooter with a PIN code, adding an extra layer of security to your ride.",

            "The Project M³ concept motorbike with its ingrained biomimicry principle is for motorheads who perceive their set of wheels not just to be a mere tool for an adrenaline-inducing rush but to have an emotional bonding with the machine. This electric bike of the future achieves what mere immortals could only muster up in their dreams!",
            "Designer: Richard Huang",
            "The two-wheeler’s basic body form is inspired by one of the most intelligent and quaint creatures, the dolphin. The electric motor onboard is charged via the blowhole-like nose, giving it a very lifelike presence. The cute character is mirrored in the toothed wheel rims and the front headlights section too. It’s more like an aquatic animal morphed into a machine to now be a non-aquatic speed demon.",
            "The motorbike is made from shape-memory alloy that adjusts the aerodynamic performance by altering the vehicle’s body form. For instance, during high-speed driving the body becomes more compact and streamlined, thereby reducing air resistance. On the other hand, at low speeds, the body expands to provide better stability and traction. So, the rider is constantly experiencing the machine as an alive creature.",
            "To elevate the feeling during low-speed driving, the vehicle’s lights will slowly flicker like a quiet and slow heartbeat. As the speed increases, the rhythm and color of the light flashing will change to resemble an accelerated heartbeat. This alive design not only adds a sense of dynamism to the bike but also enhances its visibility to other motorists during nighttime to prevent any accidents.",
            "Unlike other concept designers who limit their automotive designs to the 3D-rendered world, this one has a 1:1 real-life version too. That effort to carve the physical model for real should increase this concept bike’s probability of getting a beating heart one day!"

            "The sustainable travel trend has seeped into the motorhome and RV market for good. This has been a living reality as more and more electric vehicles go past the prototype stage and onto the manufacturing lines. For aftermarket customization shops this is the ideal opportunity to turn EVs into motorhomes fitted with every possible feature important to a nomad.",
            "For their latest build, the Dutch RV group chooses the Mercedes-Benz EQV electric van that boasts exceptional performance and comes with luxurious inclusions. The 201hp EV has a 224 miles range, honed by a 100-kWh battery unit that feeds the 150-kW electric motor. Turn it into a motorhome and you have the perfect camper van for all your unplanned adventures.",
            "Designer: Tonke and Mercedes-Benz",
            "Compared to the Adventure model, the new Nomad version drops the gas stove burner and fits an induction cooktop instead. Along with this, a sliding kitchen is an ideal inclusion for outdoor cooking lovers. This section also doubles as a makeshift workstation as one can use the cover for the dual-burner induction cooktop by sliding it inwards behind the front passenger seat. The perfect setup for digital nomads who love to cook.",
            "Their EQV Nomad can seat five people with ease, and even seven but with a few compromises in functionalities. For the nighttime, the rear seats can be folded to turn into a bed to sleep up to two individuals. If need be, the expandable pop-up roof makes way for a sleeping area for two more people. The motorhome’s bed is above the tailgate drawer system that can be used to store an optional 31L fridge, luggage, cargo boxes, or camping equipment.",
            "Compared to the Adventure camper released last year, the Nomad is a better option at the price of €77,019 (approximately $85,684) given its versatile indoor/outdoor kitchen that transforms into a space for you to work amidst nature. The camper comes with other additional options including a pop-up sleeper, EcoFlow power station, compressor refrigerator, rear drawers, and window curtains. If you happen to be in Terheijden, NL, Tonke will offer a demo at its headquarters on August 5."

        "segments": [
            "It’s safe to say that making Wheel-less Bicycles wasn’t enough for YouTuber The Q. The crazy builder is back with yet another zany invention – creating airless tires that are rugged, have shock absorption, and are entirely handmade from sliced PVC pipes.",
            "Airless tires have been around for practically decades, and even NASA has seen the merits of building tires that aren’t pressurized or prone to puncturing. However, their invention hasn’t really affected consumer-grade vehicles yet, given how complex they can be to manufacture. Most airless tires like this crazy concept by Michelin rely on incredibly complex algorithms that generatively design the wheels, which are so intricate that they can only be built using 3D printers. The Q circumvents that with a lifehack of his own – using cross-sections of a PVC pipe to replicate the same bounce of a regular tire with the robust reliability of an airless one.",
            "Designer: The Q",
            "The tire’s design bases itself on one of The Q’s older prototypes, which used 60 tennis balls instead. Although that solution seemed a lot more MacGyvered than an actual design proposition, this PVC pipe version has all the hallmarks of a clever life hack that could actually work and provide great results. Besides, a long chunk of PVC pipe beats having to buy and replace tennis balls every few weeks.",
            "To make the airless section of the tire, The Q started out by cutting out 1-inch thick sections of the PVC pipe (it also entailed choosing the right, sturdy pipe to begin with). Once he had a few hundred PVC rings, he began drilling holes into them and screwing them together around the periphery of the wheel. Each wheel required 66 PVC rings in three rows of 22 rings each, amounting to 132 rings in total. As soon as the rings were screwed together, the YouTuber mounted the wide tread on top of each wheel, completing the build.",
            "Each wheel used 66 PVC rings",
            "The video acts as a rather clever guide for people looking to build their own airless tires too. Finding the right diameter PVC pipe for your wheel frame may require some math or a little trial and error if you’re like me, but once you’ve found yourself the perfect PVC pipe, make sure you cut it to the right cross-sectional width to give yourself at least 3 rows of rings to ensure the wheel has a reliable and durable build. Obviously, we don’t recommend trying this for a motorcycle or a car… but it helps to just make our disclaimers clear!",
            "Although the tire tread mounting doesn’t look like the most secure fit, it hugged the wheel well enough for a trial run. Future builds could use an expanding PVC ring material to help securely hold the tire treads in place and prevent them from accidentally slipping off. However, the PVC construction served as a pretty decent proof of concept, requiring well under $50 worth of equipment in total.",
            "After each tire was assembled and installed back on the bicycle frame, the YouTuber took it out for a spin, riding it along on tarmac and a park pathway, occasionally alternating between the two to show the wheel’s ability to take minor bumps and undulating terrain. What The Q didn’t display in the video was rough usage (like riding down stairs) or even the condition of the wheels after a day’s worth of riding. Chances are if the wheels did incur any damage, it was probably negligible. PVC pipes are designed to be pretty durable and only show signs of wear and tear if exposed to chemicals or UV radiation like the sun. Even if one of the PVC rings does end up cracking, replacing it seems pretty easy given the broken ring can easily be visually identified, unscrewed, and replaced."

            "Buy: Hyötyajoneuvokeskus",
            "The fascinating Hupi trailer neatly combines the freedom of an e-bike with the comfort of caravan living. Unlike traditional trailers with modifiable setups, the Hupi has a fixed-roof design. Even though the headspace is not much, the single-person living unit is comfortable for sleeping and has a small dinette for your culinary requirements on the go.",
            "The concept of bicycle campers has not really seen an outgrowth like the travel trailers and RVs, but Upi’s relentless to and fro over 5,000 hours to fully perfect the bike trailer makes it a solution worth putting your money on. If you think so, Hupi is available for purchase at a base price of €5,990 (roughly $6,700).",
            "The trailer exterior is finished in aluminum with a thick urethane sheet running underneath for insulation. Hupi roof can be outfitted with a solar kit to power interior accessories and keep the e-bike fully charged and ready to go. On the inside a bed expands to fill the entire interior, providing a comfortable sleeping space for the solo cyclist. When not sleeping, the bed conveniently folds up against the front wall, transforming into a cushioned bench seat.",
            "With its narrow frame, Hupi can be effortlessly pulled by any e-bike on bike paths, opening up a world of possibilities for adventure seekers within city confines. Besides the solar panel, the trailer also offers optional electrical systems, including an onboard battery, and an inverter for interior and exterior lighting and for keeping the towing e-bike charged for all adventures you throw at it."

The tent’s outer shell comes crafted from 280G Ripstop Polycotton Canvas, capable of taking on heavy rainfall as well as G-force 7 winds. The outer shell thermoregulates the insides too, and is tested to withstand temperatures as high as 150°F or as low as -4°F. Dual-layer doors and windows keep water out, as do the YKK zippers, and a high-density mattress on a honeycomb base keeps you comfortable through all four seasons.",

The result is a unique combination of user-friendliness and user-safety, giving you a camper that’s made for anyone, any car, and for practically any situation. The tent comes with the mattress, telescopic ladder, boot holders (you obviously can’t wear shoes inside), and storage pockets included. The entire Air Cruiser weighs a mere 80 lbs for what it offers, and comes with a respectable 24-month warranty. Each Air Cruiser also ships with a carbon-negative footprint, giving you even more reason to enjoy and relish the outdoors in your new favorite cabin-on-wheels!",

        "segments": [
            "The attitude of an ATV with the body of a tank, Colin Furze’s Rhino Tank is an obnoxiously beautiful hunk of metal that really makes the Cybertruck look like a bit of a simp… Don’t quote me. However, Furze’s build isn’t really the success he hoped it would be, as he documents in the video. While the Rhino Tank looks like an absolute beast, its unique design does give up under demanding conditions, like driving down a swamp. I doubt if the Cybertruck could pull that weight on wet swampy grounds too…",
            "Designer: Colin Furze",
            "The British-based YouTuber got the idea for building this beast out to test its viability, following a few experimentations by people in the past. The Rhino Tank’s most defining feature remains its uniquely hemispherical wheels, which are designed to help give the tank traction even on uneven surfaces or when the tank’s at a slight tilt… especially in mud.",
            "The truck’s design, and its name too, come from a wild 1950s concept called the Rhino, designed and built by Elie Aghnides – an inventor also credited with designing the aerator that fits on standard taps to help conserve water. It’s said that Aghnides was inspired to create his original concept while looking at a waterfall, and had originally built out his prototype as a one-off schematic to sell to the military. It didn’t work for a variety of reasons, some of which Furze also found himself facing with his current build.",
            "To build out his 2023 redesign, Furze started off with a hydraulic dump truck, which he stripped and re-clad with a Cybertruck-like sheet-metal body. The axles were tilted to 15°, and the massive semi-circular wheels were mounted in place. The wheels featured longitudinal ridges that would serve as additional traction, along with rubber treads on the rim to help it actually grip roads and tarmacs with ease.",
            "Experimentation showed that the Rhino Tank did, indeed, work rather well on land, but had problems with inclines. The hemispherical wheels weren’t particularly great on sharp turns, giving you the feeling that you would tilt and roll over with enough centrifugal force. The wheels also struggled with mud, as Furze found himself cruising through the water rather easily (thanks to the massive wheels and their ground clearance), but getting stuck in bushes. Ultimately, it took a JCB to pull the tank out of its literal quagmire.",
            "While the build and the experimental runs were a lot of fun, Furze also pointed out the real reason why the tank was rejected by the military. Even though the hemispherical wheels were the tank’s most unique detail, they were their Achilles heel too, because if the tank was ever under fire, the hollow wheels would get pierced, allowing things like water, mud, and dirt to seep in. This would make the tank incredibly heavy and sluggish, defeating its true purpose, and also causing it to begin rusting from the inside. Maybe if we used the Cybertruck’s bulletproof steel instead…"

For this build, Oehlerking goes for a double-sided swingarm and central suspension strut.",

            "Production of the Valour will begin at Aston Martin’s Gaydon Headquarters in the third quarter of 2023, and customers can expect to receive their first deliveries in the fourth quarter of the same year. As one of Aston Martin’s highly sought-after front-engined special series sports cars, the Valour is a valuable collector’s item that’s designed to be driven, rather than be a caged beast sitting in a garage.

            "Mercedes-Benz has revived the experimental fiberglass-bodied C111-II from the 70s as a flashy new electric concept. Stunning to the core, this two-seat hypercar has a very dramatic look on the outside and inside. Just like the ultra-futuristic Vision AVTR, this one christened Vision One-Eleven has the modernized version of the wedged profile in the form of a rounded roofline and rounded flared fenders.",
            "The concept was revealed at the Mercedes’ “Design No.5” creative event, bearing the same bright orange hues sported by the 12 experimental C111 vehicles. One look at this four-wheeled damsel and it comes as no surprise the mind behind this creation is none other than Andrea Bruno, Lead Exterior Designer at Maserati.",
            "Designer: Mercedes-Benz and Andrea Bruno",
            "The front and the rear of the One-Eleven have a sci-fi feel with an array of LED headlights that illuminate the road ahead and the middle section beams custom messages for other drivers to see. Move to the back of the vehicle and you’ll see similar panels. The side profile is nailed down with a cool dual-ridge diffuser and ambient blue lighting along the rear wheels.",
            "Aerodynamic tuning is at the heart of this machine by the German automotive giant. There are three air intakes behind the headlamps, windshield at an angle of 70 degrees and dual air vents to optimize the aerodynamic performance at high speeds and on tight curves. Additionally, the electric motor housed at the rear is intelligently fed by the cool air directed via the vents behind the doors. Downforce is achieved with the large spoiler that further optimizes how the car sticks to the tarmac.",
            "Just like the half-a-century-old predecessor, One-Eleven has swanky gull-winged doors. On opening them, the retro-inspired interior reveals itself. There’s an ultra-wide digital display just like on the front grille, topped by an F1-styled yoke steering wheel and the spacecraft-inspired bucket seats trimmed in silver diamond quilting and orange leather crafted from recycled material. According to Mercedes, the concept can drive forward in two different modes – Race and Lounge. The former has a better HUD view for clear vision while the latter reconfigures for a laid-back arrangement for driving comfort.",
            "One-Eleven comes is propelled forward with a fully electric powertrain employing a single axial-flux motor. Yes, that’s the same technology used in Koenigsegg’s Quark electric motor. This motor is better than the radial-flux motor since they have way better tech for peak performance and efficiency without compromising the mechanical operation. Although Mercedes hasn’t revealed any tech specs of the concept, still loaded with this advanced electric motor, the ride should outperform most competitors. As an added perk, the compact size of the motor frees up space for storing luggage."

The invincible character reflected in the aerodynamically tuned build is what sets this racing machine apart from the ordinary.",
            "Designer: Radka Zvarova",
            "Robust monoshock swingarm setup on the rear and the front maintains the structural integrity of the bike while lowering the stance for a more reassuring ride setup. The wide apart wheelbase distributes the weight of the machine in a delicate balancing act of automotive engineering.",
            "Handlebars are integrated into the main unit to decrease the sideways air drag and not strain Ayra’s electric motor any more than desired. That’s presuming it is fed by a powerful electric motor since Radka doesn’t make any mention of the powertrain of this motorbike. Going by the design layout here, in all probability the central unit houses the compact electric motor that can be charged via a fast charging unit.",
            "The Cyberpunk appeal of the motorbike is something to behold here, given the extent to which the front stretches in this concept. That should make the Ayra highly maneuverable at chicanes, in a way, juxtaposing it with the flavor of a café racer. The headlights adopt a hunter-eyes-like stance, similar to a wild cat crouching down to pounce on its prey unaware.",
            "Decals and graphics have a minimalist geometric presence in a contrasting mono-color that complements the polished metal body frame. There are quite a few classy color options to choose from that are primarily targeted toward the young crowd. So, who wants Ayra to come to life someday?"

The bright red damsel mirrors the key details of the original version including the hard or open-top configuration, opening hood and truck that houses the V8 engine replica with its own spinning radiator fan.",

To take the nostalgic element a notch further, the 1210-piece LEGO set comes with three different sets of license plates to traverse millennials to a different era.",
            "Truly a worthy inclusion to the LEGO Icons line, the classic Chevvy measuring 13 inches in length, 6 inches in width and 4 inches in height will be a pleasant weekend task to piece together for the living room shelf or geeky den. For that, you’ll have to wait till August 1 (for LEGO VIPs) or August 4, when the LEGO Corvette set will be finally released for a price tag of $150."

A better alternative to two-wheelers and trikes, a quadricycle has reassured balance, better safety, and is suited for the varying requirements of demanding users.",
            "A couple of years ago, FIAT launched the electric Citroën Ami which is a pint-sized EV designed for Gen-Z. Now the Italian auto manufacturer has engineered the Topolino inspired by the two-door FIAT 500. The subcompact car is slated to hit the market in the first half of next year in peppy colors, and that’s an interesting development.",
            "Designer: FIAT",
            "Measuring just 2.53 meters the all-electric city EV has a 7.2-meter turning radius for shimming around tight spaces where standard vehicles get stuck. Topolino gets the 6kW electric motor which should be ample for slow city riding. Given the small size, there’s a 5.5kWh battery which only churns out a promised range of 47 miles and a top speed of 28mph. That should be more than enough for short-range mobility in urban areas.",
            "FIAT will bring the EV in two variants: a closed-doored and hard-topped version and an open doorless soft-topped variant dubbed Topolino Doce Vita. These two variants will have the same color options, 14-inch wheels and two-seat interiors. The only difference is, the closed version has a sunblind roof and wooden finish stickers on doors. The open version for tropical regions gets door sills, door rope and striped stickers.",
            "Along with these base features, the Topolino will have optional accessories including a luggage bag (stored between driver and passenger), USB fan, Bluetooth speaker, thermal water bottle, rear luggage rack and seat covers that double as beach towels. In total there’s going to be 63 liters of interior storage space to haul other vital gear. No wonder FIAT tactically refrains from calling this EV a car, and labels it as an electric mobility device.",
            "The compact EV will come at a list price of €9,890 (approximately $10,700) which is more expensive than the Ami. FIAT will position the Topolino as a more premium option and time will tell if it delivers on the promise of reliable city commuting."

However, in reality, this bike surpasses all expectations with its remarkable character and capabilities. Its single-cylinder 660cc engine boasts impressive torque, allowing for effortless acceleration from low speeds. With a riding position inspired by motocross, generous ground clearance, and long-travel suspensions, it seems pretty evident that this bike has supermoto roots. The vibrations and thunderous roars emitted from its exhaust pipes only enhance this perception… so Ukrainian designer Rostyslav Matiukhin decided to give it a facelift. Dubbed the Revise MT03, this motorcycle gets the personality upgrade it needed. Ditching the overly ‘dudebro’ fairing, this new body kit is the kind people take seriously.

The fuel tank is stripped bare of any extraneous plastic, and replaced with new side radiator covers. Right above them lie the supermoto handguards, with a new headlight and windshield in front. The front and rear fenders get upgrades too, as does the taillight, which will probably be the last thing you see as this motorcycle disappears into the distance.",

He’s made the world’s smallest bicycle, a bicycle with 60 tennis balls for tires, and even one with split, semi-circular wheels. The great part about all his experiments is that as bizarre they may sound, they still work at the end of the day… and you get the pleasure of watching The Q build out the bicycle concepts throughout the video, just in case you want to build your own wacky mode of transportation too!",

The bike comes with two sets of wheel belts, mounted at absurd angles to create one of the most attention-gripping silhouettes one could imagine. The way the Wheelless Bike works is sort of like a tank, with the rotating wheel belts driving you forward. Is it ‘technically correct’ to say that this bicycle doesn’t have wheels? No, because it does have rotating elements all across the board… but it ditches those large rubberized wheels that make up the iconic bicycle’s archetype.",

Don’t expect to hit high speeds, given how small the wheel belt’s curved radius is, but you can definitely expect a few curious stares and maybe a couple of questions from bewildered onlookers! Would I recommend riding this on rough terrain or a bumpy road? Probably not!",
            "To build the wheelless bike, The Q found himself a bike frame sans the wheels. Instead of installing the conventional circular wheels, though, he used linear metal members with chains mounted on the rim, and a rubber tread around the chains, like the wheel belt seen on tanks. To have the pedals work this belt, The Q added another gear to the bike frame, connecting the pedals to the top of the rear ‘wheel’. To secure the wheels in place, they were then fixed at two points, allowing them to hold their angular mounting position as you rode the bicycle.",
            "The entirely silent YouTube video doesn’t provide much scope for justification – for example, why angle the treads when you could make them flat like a tank for extra stability? Or why build something as absurd as this AT ALL? However, the 6-minute 47-second visual journey The Q takes on is quite a fun ride… just like his bicycle, I suppose!"

According to Andy, the submerged cylindrical hulls fused to the main structure of the yacht with “stilts of minimal cross-section.”",
            "This has undeniable advantages such as high tolerance for pitch and roll, making the vessel safe and comfortable for the occupants. If we are to take Andy’s word, Decadence reduces the pitch and roll by almost 70 percent as compared to a conventional monohull. Coming on to the layout, the yacht has a 30-meter beam and an interior configuration of 5,000 GT.",

One such option is to expand the master suite to almost 20 -meters in width, 30 meters in length and with a three-meter-high ceiling. This makes for one of the most luxe setups there could ever be living on the seas. Guests are also taken care of as the main hull is reserved for them while the crew can enjoy their stay in the sponsons or the outer hull that are equally swanky.",
            "Setting up anchor for a stop with the Decandence is going to be a struggle for most situations given its humungous size. The maker wants to address this with 14-meter chase boat tenders to ferry the seafarers to the shores in luxury. What about the catamaran itself though? Well, the sturdy design means it can be parked out in the turbulent seas even in the most inclement weather.",
            "The vessel is going to be powered by a radical new propulsion system that’ll bring down energy consumption by almost 30 percent. From the look of things, retractable inflatable sails can also be erected in headwinds to further increase fuel saving without compromising speed."

            "As a community of people who literally help build new technologies for the world, designers aren’t new to VR-based tools. AR/VR headsets have been available for the better part of a decade now, and designers have formed perhaps one of the largest demographics to use these devices for sketching, modeling, rendering, and reviewing designs. With the announcement of the Vision Pro headset, Apple’s making a pivot to ‘spatial computing’, and it only seems like VR/AR/MR tools will get a lot more democratized in the future, not just on the design end, but also the visual-aid end, allowing consumers/customers to see products before buying them. In this case, you wouldn’t have to travel to see a car like this Lamborghini Vision Event Horizon, you could just pop on a headset and enjoy the car’s visual aesthetic virtually… or spatially, as Apple would probably say.",
            "Designed by Taiwan-based Lewis Lin, the Lamborghini Vision Event Horizon is a next-gen hybrid supercar that’s championed by VRAD, or Virtual Reality Assisted Design – a natural progression from years of CAD or Computer Assisted Design. Lin altered his existing workflow, using tools like Procreate for sketching, Gravity Sketch for modeling, and then KeyShot for rendering. Using a VR sketching/modeling program like Gravity Sketch helped Lin actually experience the car’s overall design as he built it. Proportions and details made much more sense when viewed in scale, and the car’s overall design stood out much more when observed beyond the boundaries of a flat, 16:9 desktop monitor or laptop screen.",
            "Designer: Lewis Lin",
            "Rendered on KeyShot: Click Here to Download Your Free Trial Now!",
            "The Lamborghini Vision Event Horizon is a stunning car that amps up the Italian marque’s design language in an attempt to differentiate itself from the company’s older, ICE cars. A common trend with electric or even hybrid cars is to embrace a plain, metallic paint job, which the Vision Event Horizon does too – quite similar to Polestar cars or most Priuses seen on the roads. However, unlike the aforementioned, the Vision Event Horizon embraces the Lamborghini DNA too, with an edgy, aggressive exterior, angular paneling, and a signature wedge-shaped side profile.",
            "What stands out with this car is the headlight and taillight treatment, which feels slightly different from other Lamborghinis. The front of the car gives me Acura NSX GT3 Evo vibes, albeit with crowbar-shaped LED-strip headlights. The rear puts a neat spin on Lamborghini’s Y-shaped taillights with a more contemporary redesign. The two exhausts right below it scream power too, although given its hybrid drivetrain, there’s a sense of reassurance that the power is supplemented by clean energy too.",
            "The Vision Event Horizon seats two in its comfortably spacious interiors. Lin only modeled the exteriors, so it’s difficult to say what the interiors look like, or what’s under the hood. If this thing’s a true modern Lamborghini, the engine will be located in the rear, right under the three fins that help with downforce and cornering, as well as working as antennas to help amplify cellular/radio signal within the car.",
            "Lin explained his entire design process on his Behance page. “In this project, I used the GRAVITY SKETCH to enter Virtual Reality after sketching and used the sketch as a foundation to swiftly produce a realistic scale three-dimensional model in space. The sensory stimulation provided by the 3D space model is not accessible in 2D sketching. It allows me to extract more distinct thinking and ideas in the early stages of the design, giving me a more holistic picture,” he said.\n“I draw a rough sketch in Procreate, and this is used as a basis to create the basic framework in the Gravity Sketch using the stroke function and laying out the uneven surfaces. After completing the exploratory model, I imported the model into Rhinoceros to meet the final model.”"

            "With an exterior that draws a careful balance between aggressive and minimal, the Lamborghini Purixta concept distils the Italian marque’s design DNA to its purest form. The intent of designers Euan, Giuseppe, and Che, was to retain the essence of what makes a Lamborghini a Lamborghini… but without that strong, harsh character that you see in cars like the Terzo Millennio, or the Sian.",
            "Created as the result of an extensive design exercise, the Purixta is what you get when Marie Kondo meets aggressive Italian racecars. The Purixta focuses on visual and practical purity, with a single-seater cockpit reminiscent of the Egoista in the hopes of giving the driver the ultimate thrill of the new, distilled Lamborghini experience.",
            "Designers: Euan McPherson, Giuseppe Starace, and Che Chien Liao",
            "Most great supercar designs are actually a collaborative effort between the designer’s pen strokes and the actual strokes of moving air which gives the car its aerodynamics. Lamborghini’s automobiles have mastered this balance beautifully, with cars that can cut through the air with finesse, while retaining a wonderfully unique character. The Purixta’s mastery of that balance is what makes it so great. The car is merely an intersection of multiple lines, resulting in an angular mass that both looks and moves like a predator.",
            "The Purixta’s use of lines is evident in its side profile as well as its back. The side looks like a designer’s rough sketch come to life, with multiple lines slashing through the car’s lithe form, even culminating in some stunning line-based headlights and taillights. Move to the back, however, and you notice how the Purixta tries to be different from its predecessors. Sure, there’s no rear windshield, just like most Lamborghinis, but you also don’t have the signature Y-shaped taillights, which have come to become a Lamborghini rite of passage, in a way. The new taillight, however, feels unapologetically futuristic, and the angular lines feel reminiscent of the large air intakes seen on the front of the company’s most popular cars.",
            "The cockpit of the Purixta seats merely one, giving the driver the ultimate thrill. With a racecar-style cockpit that puts you in the front and center of the action, the Purixta sports an entirely clear front panel that extends all the way from the bumper till the top of the car, creating an almost triangular panel of transparency that lets the driver see even what’s immediately in front of the car. Side window panels also offer a view of the left and right-hand side of the driver, although you can’t really roll down the windows on this one, like the Egoista… However, with a ride as thrilling as this, you’ll never see me complaining!"

Sergii Gordieiev, who’s an engineer by profession and inventive fabricator by nature, bamboozled us with his earlier creation and now, another fresh DIY has left us yearning for more.",
            "Just like the square-wheeled bicycle that seemed logically impossible to move – but still, it did smoothly – this ingenious build too surprises with its nifty engineering. The ingenious bicycle riding on wheels with rollers move in a linear manner, forming adjacent lines between each one of the rollers and the flat surface it’s riding on. This enables the triangle wheels to overcome their limitation and roll more comfortably than presumed.",
            "Designer: Sergii Gordieiev",
            "Even more so, the bicycle can traverse and maneuver uneven terrain like dirt trails with equal dexterity. If we think based on the laws of physics, for the Reuleaux triangle-shaped wheels it is the “simplest and best-known curve of constant width other than the circle.”",
            "The DIY bike is ridden like any other pedal-powered bicycle even though it looks highly improbable. Also, the rider doesn’t feel as much discomfort as one would assume. Articulated arms soak up most of the wheel’s movement and don’t transfer it to the rider. Truly a feat of engineering that’s a cakewalk for Sergii, given his previous builds.",
            "Although it doesn’t ride as smoothly as the square-shaped version, still the dampening of all that lateral movement is an achievement. Just seeing those wheels and the noise coming from them will grab anyone’s attention."

The same follows down to the instrument cluster and the gear selector salvaged from a more modern ride. Just so that the riders don’t get bored, the hotrod is fitted with a Pioneer head unit. The seats of the modified Camaro have been reinforced with more cushioning to alleviate pressure from Scire’s spine which is totally understandable.",

There’s a hand-built 350-cubic-inch 5.7-liter V8 which is a part of the Small Block engine family. The choice holds relevance since it is easier to tune and exhale through a custom-made exhaust system with side-mounted outlets. Also, the automatic transmission of the Camaro has been retained here. All this suggests the hotrod will be faster than the donor car, and it’s stunning to look at after all!"

            "The North American microbus’s interior outshines its competition. Three unique, custom interiors are available, each designed to captivate and cater to individual preferences. Whether it’s the urban ambiance with dark brown seats and blue door inserts, the coastal theme’s light tones, or the ’70s retro-inspired cognac brown seats with yellow piping, and there’s an interior to suit every preference.",
            "Inside the microbus, comfort and utility reign supreme. Seven seats are standard, with the option to swap out for captain’s chairs, reducing the seat count to six. Standard leatherette seats come with heated and ventilated functionality that features 12-way power adjustment, memory function, and massage, and all are included as standard amenities. As a passenger vehicle, ensuring the comfort of occupants is paramount.",
            "The seating layout is versatile and designed to accommodate various needs and purposes. The middle row, a 60/40 split-fold seat, can also slide forward by approximately 20 centimeters. The third row follows a similar design but adds the convenience of being removable, ensuring that additional cargo space can be made available when needed.",
            "At a height of 6’2″, there was plenty of space for both my legs and head in the second and third rows. I found it much easier to get in and out of the third row compared to any minivan or SUV I’ve tried before. This makes the ID.BUZZ one of the most versatile vehicles for moving people in any consumer class.",
            "In the ID.BUZZ, I found it very simple to remove the third-row seats. A quick tug on a string released the latch, allowing the seats to easily slide back. Additionally, the seats had a carrying handle for convenient transport and storage. Reinstalling the seats was just as easy, with a straightforward reverse process. The ID.BUZZ’s design and execution is notably thoughtful, especially when compared to traditional minivans that have captain’s seats.",
            "The ID.BUZZ also introduces a new 12.9-inch infotainment display, equipped with illuminated sliders for temperature and volume control and a dedicated climate document. The vehicle boasts features that amplify convenience and comfort, most of which are standard in the entry model. Highlights include power sliding doors, a power horizontal sliding second-row window, a power tailgate with a kick-to-open function, three-zone climate control, and minimal optional equipment.",
            "Additional optional features include a panoramic electrochromic roof that considerably opens up the cabin, and a pre-heated windshield, among others.",
            "Safety, convenience, and driver assistance are all consolidated under the IQ Drive umbrella. A standout feature of this suite is the travel assist functionality, which blends adaptive cruise control and lane assist. As long as drivers maintain slight contact with the steering wheel, the vehicle handles the rest, making the journey both comfortable and enjoyable. Other IQ Drive features include Remote Parking, Head Up Display, and an area view.",
            "The return of the microbus is more than just a nostalgic comeback; it represents a complete rethinking of what a vehicle can be. It blends the best of both worlds, with a mix of classic design and modern functionality, creating a perfect balance of style and practicality. This vehicle is more than just a means of transportation; it offers a unique experience, makes a statement, and owning one means possessing a piece of history while traveling into the future. The wait has been long, but the consensus is that it has been worth it. Having had the chance to test drive the European version of the ID.BUZZ, I am eager to share its unique appeal and the joy of operating such a distinctive vehicle—the ID.BUZZ will be available on the market next year, with pricing details yet to be released."

            "In a world plagued by disasters, if you imagine towing a trailer right through the heart of a catastrophe without an iota of doubt, Mammoth Overland dares to offer a solution in the ELE Trailer. Combining mobility with utmost safety and self-reliance, ELE is designed to be the ultimate towable survival bunker.",
            "To honor that image, the ELE Trailer is engineered to withstand the harshest of conditions, including a zombie apocalypse. It is also prepared for other, more realistic, misadventures such as a bear attack or a wildfire. The limited-edition ELE Trailer would be available toward the end of 2023 at a starting price of $67,000 for all overlanding enthusiasts venturing out on the most extreme adventures.",

            "If you have been in the wilderness and a bear has walked past without disturbing your solitude, it’s fine, but if you have been in a situation where a bear has clawed on your fragile trailer; you understand the need for a mobile home to be bear-proof.",
            "Mammoth president Scott Taylor, drawing from his experience of growing up in Montana, where bear-proofing is important, if you think of spending time in the outdoors, has crafted the ELE Trailer from aircraft standard materials. Double-walled aerospace-grade aluminum body with high-density foam insulation sandwiched in between sits on a steel chassis. The construction becomes more intriguing at the submarine-style pressure doors, which render the trailer airtight to prevent air infiltration in addition to keeping the bears out.",
            "The ELE cuts out the contaminated air from entering, but doesn’t leave you gasping for fresh air. To ensure clean and fresh air, a medical-grade air filtration system is installed to purify the entered air. Capable of completely purifying the interior air in under 3 minutes, this system can sustain occupants for up to 6 months with purified air.",
            "This is not it; the trailer boasts a range of unique features including bear spray defense system, medical-grade air filtration, and a drone launch system. This true fortress on wheels can be outfitted with optional Level 3 bulletproof as well (costing additional).",
            "The innovative bear spray system comprises two replaceable canisters located at the front of the trailer. A switch inside the cabin turns on the canisters and a powerful mist is sprayed around the exterior to deter the attacking bear or any other potential threat. Even if you don’t choose to bulletproof the ELE, it is integrated with lockable weapons storage allowing you to access a gun when needed. This raises the bar of your level of preparedness in the trailer that can go anywhere you want.",
            "ELE Trailer is not only to live in the city confines, when disaster comes calling, you can ride out to the safe confines and live off-grid for a bit. To take care of your safe water needs, you get an 83-liter water tank onboard with Guzzle H2O filtration system. Power needs are satiated by a 100-Ah smart lithium battery and 100-W solar panels. It comes loaded with an exterior fold-out kitchen with a sink and a two-burner stove. An awning can be set up to create a cozy outdoor space",
            "To ensures enhanced security during moments of rest and relaxation, and to fulfill the sentiment of preparedness, the ELE Trailer also boasts advanced surveillance capabilities. A gimbal-mounted night-vision camera on the roof keeps a hawk-eye on the outside and delivers the feed to an onboard 32-inch TV. For the camera operations, and to stay connected with the outside world at all times, the ELE is installed with Starlink internet."

        "segments": [
            "It is, in fact, possible to download a car. Sterling Backus, enthusiastic father and physicist, literally downloaded and 3D printed an entire Lamborghini Aventador. Sterling started by first downloading a 1:10 scale model of the Aventador, scaling it up, separating the parts, and even adding a few signature modifications of his own, like making the car’s body wider. The process did take 5 whole years, but the results are so remarkable that even Lamborghini reached out to help in any ways that they could by donating parts like the Aventador’s headlights, which cost a whopping $5,000 a piece, and an original Lamborghini steering wheel, to replace the Audi steering wheel that Sterling had installed previously.",
            "This video comes courtesy 3D Printing Nerd, a YouTuber who interviewed Sterling this month to track his 5-year journey. Sterling hopes to have the Aventador absolutely ready by August, where it’ll be on display at an auto-show.",
            "Designer: Sterling Backus",
            "3D printing an entire car sounds somewhat plausible when you’ve got industrial-grade equipment at hand. Sterling had just a Creality Cr 10S, an incredibly bare-basic $350 printer used for hobby projects. To print the car, Sterling split up all the surfaces into small 1 square-foot parts that he printed and glued together using epoxy. Imagine building a car using jigsaw puzzle pieces – that’s pretty much what Sterling did. He pushed the printer to its absolute limit, running it continuously for 15 full months before the printer died on him. Luckily, he managed to print the entire outer body by then. However, there was a small problem…",
            "You see, the Cr 10S doesn’t print metal or carbon fiber. It prints with standard PLA filament, which is great for tiny toys… but not so much for large supercars. PLA has a glass transition temperature of 50-60°C (131-140°F), which means at those temperatures, it begins to go soft and start warping. That’s a problem when you’ve got outdoor temperatures that can sometimes touch 50°C and a V12 engine under the hood that definitely crosses those temperatures. To overcome this, Sterling coated each and every surface with 6 layers of carbon fiber sheet (3 on top, and 3 on the bottom), vacuum sealing the carbon fiber onto the panels to ensure there were no warps or bubbles. Once each panel was sandwiched with the carbon fiber, Sterling coated them with automotive primer and got to work sanding each piece to perfection with his son.",
            "The highlight of the Aventador are those headlights, which apparently cost 5 grand apiece. However, when Sterling began his project, word got to the Lamborghini executives, who decided to give him two original Aventador headlights, sparing in $10K in expenses. The windshield on the original Aventador costs another $4,000, but Sterling made do with a windshield from a Pacifica minivan, which he had trimmed to size. The taillights, however, Sterling printed on his own, given that the wide-body build he was going for would not fit Lamborghini’s stock taillights.",
            "Perhaps the most challenging part of the build was to get the Aventador’s signature scissor doors right. Even as a physicist, it’s something Sterling just couldn’t seem to nail… and Lamborghini’s door hinges cost a thousand dollars apiece. Luckily, Sterling wasn’t the only one 3D printing an Aventador at the same time. Another hobbyist who was building an Aventador of his own had some hinges to spare, which he gave to Sterling.",
            "What’s the most impressive fact is that this entire car is built from scratch. Rather than stripping a junk car of its outer fairing and layering an Aventador’s pieces onto it, Sterling built his chassis manually, welding pieces of metal together to bring his car to life. The metal chassis would then hold each individual PLA and carbon fiber piece, creating the car’s aesthetic.",
            "You’re probably wondering what Sterling did for the engine (it isn’t possible to 3D print those yet). Under the Aventador’s (rear) hood isn’t Lamborghini’s signature V12, but instead is an LS1, a V8 manufactured by GM and used in the Corvette. The transmission on the Aventador, funnily enough, isn’t a Lamborghini stock too but rather is taken from a Porsche 911.",
            "Once Sterling finished finalizing his build (and even making the interiors), Lamborghini’s director of marketing took a look at his progress, only to pop his head in and see an Audi steering wheel fitted into the car’s dash. A lot of Lamborghinis use Audi parts, Sterling mentioned, highlighting that Audi and Lamborghini are owned by the same company, VW. The steering column on the Aventador, for example, is the same one found in Audi cars, so it seemed like a natural pick for Sterling. He didn’t have an Aventador steering wheel, so he decided to stick with the Audi one that fit perfectly into the column – something Lamborghini’s director of marketing didn’t quite approve of.  Two weeks later, Sterling found a Lamborghini steering wheel in the mail straight from Italy. The Italians don’t like it when you mess with tradition, whether it’s putting ketchup in your pasta or an Audi steering wheel in your Aventador!",
            "The overall build still needs some work, and Sterling is hoping to give the car a Red, White, and Black paint job once everything’s ready. The 3D-printed Aventador weighs just around 2700 lbs, making it significantly lighter than the original which clocks in at 4000 lbs. For now, Sterling is still working on finishing the car’s exteriors as well as fine-tuning some of the electrical parts of the car as well as the interior – something he hopes to get done before August. The 3D-printed Aventador is slated to make its first proper appearance at the Bandimere Speedway near Detroit on August 13th."

            "The problem with EVs is that adoption grows MUCH faster than infrastructure. It takes months or even years to set up an EV charging grid big enough to serve current needs, but tens of thousands of new people buy EVs on a daily basis. How does one solve for such a problem? Robotic Chargers, says one Seattle-based startup.",
            "Dubbed the future of EV charging, AUTEV’s autonomous robot chargers move around, charging EVs wherever they are, rather than having the EV travel to a charging station. These autonomous chargers-on-wheels help cover areas where the charging infrastructure isn’t set up yet, given their ability to move around from car to car, charging each one. This, in turn, helps boost EV sales, allowing people who were previously hesitant to be more confident in taking up electric cars, knowing that they can rely on AUTEV’s charging services anywhere.",
            "Designer: Autev",
            "The AUTEV robot is a small, pod-like device on four wheels that can autonomously move around parking lots, charging EVs using the batteries that are housed inside it. Users can summon an AUTEV robot using an app, and when the robot reaches its destination, all you really need to do is plug its charging outlet into your car. You can then go about running your errands, knowing fully well that your car is being charged in the meantime.",
            "AUTEV offers a mobile power solution that can be rapidly implemented to address the increasing demand for electric vehicles without the need for extra permanent infrastructure, resulting in greater cost-efficiency and scalability. “Our market research has shown that there is a huge gap in the market between the increase of EVs on the streets and how EV charging infrastructure is growing. Building new public charging stations or dedicated EV charging parking spaces in areas of shared parking presents logistical challenges,” says Founder and CEO of AUTEV, Osama AlSalloum. Cofounder and COO Syd Manna adds, “We have developed an autonomous charging robot that can provide on-demand charging wherever it is needed. Our technology reduces the need for a fixed charging infrastructure and makes EV charging more convenient for EV owners.”",
            "AUTEV is aiming to make fleets of these robots available for garage operators to use commercially by the beginning of next year. These operators will be charged a monthly fee and will generate revenue from both customers who use the robot chargers, as well as advertising that runs on the robot’s displays."

            "Renowned carmaker BMW and maritime pioneer TYDE have unveiled THE ICON, a high-end electric watercraft yacht that soars above water. Revealed at Port de Cannes, THE ICON is a one-of-a-kind geometric and elevated hydrofoil yacht that leverages the German automaker’s high-voltage “BMW i” batteries to achieve emission-free travel combined with luxurious aesthetics.",
            "Hovering ever so gently above the water, THE ICON is a small-sized battery-powered yacht with a stunning, faceted gem-like design. Unlike other yachts its size, THE ICON ditches the combustion engine for an electric powertrain, while also relying on a hydrofoil that heavily decreases aerodynamic drag, making it not just dazzling to the eye, but even when it comes to hitting high speeds.",
            "Designers: BMW & TYDE",
            "THE ICON measures 13.15 meters and has a top speed of 30 knots or 55 km/h. It uses hydrofoils, a technology borrowed from yacht racing, to achieve high speeds and reduce energy use. The hydrofoils lift the hull above the water, reducing resistance and enabling faster speeds. The foiling technology is only one aspect of THE ICON’s advanced design. The watercraft is powered by a pair of 100 kW electric motors that convert the energy from six BMW i3 batteries into a range of over 50 nautical miles. This extended range is a significant achievement for battery-powered marine craft.",
            "THE ICON is a product of Designworks, BMW’s innovative design hub, in collaboration with boat manufacturer TYDE. The design of THE ICON is a departure from conventional maritime aesthetics, with a body that spans 4.5 meters at its broadest point in the rear, tapering to a semi-pointed tip reminiscent of a flat hull design. Geometric lines contour the body, perfectly framing the expansive ocean views.",
            "The interior design of THE ICON is inspired by origami, creating an inviting and visually striking environment. The sloping ceiling and intricate design elements combined with the large windows create a light-filled, refreshing space. The color scheme, dominated by green and blue hues, enhances the fresh, modern atmosphere.",
            "Unique design choices continue at the entrance of THE ICON, where BMW has fashioned angled doors. These doors aren’t merely functional; they’re sculpted from sections of metal sheeting to echo the curves of the interior design elements. This results in a textured surface that reflects sunlight onto the floor, recreating the beautiful interplay of light that one might see with waves on the sea. The chairs in the interior rotate 360°, offering occupants a stunning panoramic view of the sea around them as well as of the yacht’s edgy, luxurious design.",
            "The captain of the yacht enjoys the expansive cockpit, which features a 32-inch touchscreen display with 6K resolution that serves as a navigation guide and a voice-activated feature that enables the captain to request range and weather information verbally.",
            "Adding to the unique experience on THE ICON, BMW has partnered with renowned film score composer Hans Zimmer to provide an exclusive soundtrack for passengers. This soundtrack further enhances the experience for riders who can hop onto THE ICON for a short spin in the waters of the Bay of Cannes.",
            "BMW unveiled THE ICON at the prestigious Port de Cannes, a fitting launch venue for this innovative watercraft. With THE ICON, BMW and THE TYDE have successfully combined luxury design and environmentally conscious performance to create a new paradigm in marine travel. This watercraft invites passengers to experience the future of luxury marine travel, where design, performance, and carbon-free transport intersect."

These Bugatti Chiron SUV concepts are pretty much the same thing – they’re half sleek Bugatti supercars, half otherworldly Mad Max-style monster vehicles. Generated by AI artist Flybyartist, these customized Bugatti Chirons aren’t meant for garages… they’re meant to brave zombie apocalypses, endure the elements, and get you from A to B regardless of what’s in between. In style, of course!",

These images scream Mad Max a little too loudly, but then again, you don’t see me complaining. If the 2019 Chiron Super Sport 300+ was the fastest car on land, these Chiron Utility Vehicles would be the fastest car on sand.",
            "Each concept has the characteristics of a Chiron, with those super-sleek headlights, the C-shaped pillar, and a semblance of that horseshoe cutout grille on the front. However, the Chiron’s audacity gets amped up with those angular panels, aggressive air-intakes on the front, and conquer-everything tires. The ground clearance gets a bump too, given the need to be able to drive comfortably on rough terrain, and in a few concepts, you’ve also got the hint of a truck bed at the back. Finally, a few fog lights on top of the roof give the Chiron its off-road persona, and that black-and-red paint job ensures the Chiron blends right into its sandy home, while also screaming for attention when it’s hurtling towards you at those high speeds that only the quad-turbocharged W16 engine is capable of!"

After the family-oriented Boulder, the Colorado company has outed a pair of patent-pending teardrop camping trailers called Electric Classic that call out to both EV and non-EV owners.",
            "Designed in two variants, essential for those looking to extend camping trips in the outdoors, the teardrop trailers provide additional off-grid energy to power equipment and devices on board, or juice up your electric vehicle on the journey back home.",
            "Designer: Colorado Teardrops",
            "The chief advantage of the Electric Classics models is the amount of power available. The EC models – EC-2 and EC-4 – come integrated with battery systems, providing 19 kWh to 38 kWh of battery power, to use while camping or as whole-home battery when not camping. Putting that to prospective, the company notes – with up to 38 kWh of battery power – the trailer can power an average US home for over a day.",
            "Coming to the two different models, the EC-2 is a two-person teardrop trailer while EC-4, on that notion, is a larger 4-person model. Both are inspired by the previous bestsellers from the brand and are constructed using welded structural aircraft aluminum. The triple-insulated construction renders the trailers durable and lightweight, while the protection on the bottom of the cabin protects and seals them against the elements.",
            "The interior of the Colorado Teardrop’s EC-2 and EC-4 are free from plastic in the walls, cabinetry, and shelving, however, have been made warm and comfortable for the inhabitants. For this, the teardrops feature maple or hardwood laminates and have insulated doors with sliding windows that open up the interiors to the great outdoors, while keeping the camping trailer tightly sealed otherwise.",
            "On the outside, the trailer tongue box offers additional storage and accommodates the electrical components. Interestingly, the Colorado Teardrops’ EC models are not for everyone: The two-person EC-2 starts at $44,000 and the four-person EC-4 base model is priced at $50,400. An upgrade to a 38 kWh battery pack will set up back an additional $11,000."

Yes, Ferruccio Lamborghini started off by building tractors way back in the late 1940s, and after being insulted by Enzo Ferrari he decided to build his own luxurious high-speed car. The first ever model, Lamborghini 350 GT rolled out of the assembly lines in 1963 and there’s been no looking back since then.",
            "So, it makes logical sense to hand-built a limited-edition tractor to commemorate the memory of the Italian craftsman and remember his legacy that kicked off with Lamborghini Trattori. Now, the 1960 Lamborghini Centenary limited-edition tractor is the result of a trip back in time when motor racing was not a thing.",

Thus, an automotive collector’s item that’s numbered four, and rare by every stretch of imagination. The fully-operational tractor being an amalgam of the 60s builds – the DLA and 2R DT, bears a rustic look, amplifying the nostalgic feel for someone who’s witnessed the era in question.",
            "Its body is crafted from raw metal and kept unfinished to ensure it ages over time owing to the natural weathering. Adler has deliberately exposed the metal to oxidation for the patina effect, thereby increasing the value even more so. Lamborghini Centenario gets the 2.2-liter three-cylinder diesel engine from the DLA 35, the six individual side-exhaust pipes exhibit its power-churning character.",
            "The ultra-rustic body is complemented by the classy instrument cluster, engine start key, place to keep those cigarettes and Agri Max RT 355 matte black wheels reminding of the long-gone era. All these attributes make the automotive creation elusive for a Lamborghini fanatic. For a price tag of $540,625 the one-off raging bull is surely not for the countryside fields."

        "segments": [
            "If wood is strong enough for buildings and furniture, why not use it for bicycles too? That’s pretty much the thought process that led Masateru Yasuda to design the Moccle, a bicycle that relies on the flexible yet sturdy properties of bent plywood sheets. Traditional Japanese buildings have taken advantage of wood’s flexibility and vibration-absorption properties to build structures that have survived earthquakes, Yasuda points out. “I wondered if I could make a bicycle that takes advantage of the characteristics of this wood,” he adds.",
            "The Moccle is a fun bicycle with a unique aesthetic that puts the enjoyment of riding front and center. It doesn’t come with gears, a dashboard, or even shock absorbers (funnily enough, there’s no bell on it too), but rather, uses a bent-wood frame to achieve shock absorption. Held in place using metal fixtures, the bent plywood frame flexes in response to pressure, helping absorb any sort of stress by undulating surfaces or bad terrain… just the way traditional buildings in Japan would weather earthquakes by absorbing tectonic stress.",
            "Designer: Masateru Yasuda",
            "Yasuda makes a rather interesting point about how wood is basically carbon-fiber, but occurs naturally. Trees, like all living organisms, are carbon-based… which makes wood more similar to carbon fiber than you’d think. To make the frame, Yasuda first created his plywood, sandwiching thin sheets of carbon fiber between sheets of wood just to make the frame age-proof and resistant to shrinkage or cracking. The final ply was then cut into its desired profiles, before being bent into shape using steam. Finally, the wooden frame was plugged into its metal holders, giving you a bicycle that’s sturdy yet flexible, and designed to last long.",
            "“Moccle is a bicycle that you can easily ride in casual clothes. A simple design that anyone can ride without a complicated transmission,” Yasuda says. “Just pedaling with your usual sneakers, you can spend a relaxing time at your favorite cafe. The bike’s simple design highlights its use case perfectly. It isn’t made for performance, or for terrain. The Moccle is a purely recreational two-wheeler designed to just enjoy life. The project started in 1999 and the 1st wooden bicycle was made in Osaka, Japan. The 2nd model was made in Nagano and named Moccle in 2012. The 3rd model wooden bicycle started production in 2019 and was exhibited at the Wood Collection Show in Tokyo in January 2023.",

The car features a beautiful single-panel windshield that extends all the way to the top, while splitting into two at the rear to create an air-vent-like design. The split rear windscreen is complemented by similarly latitudinal taillights, followed by exhausts built right into the fairing.",

            "When you think of camping, probably one of the staple foods that you can bring along with you and eat in front of the fire are beans. But when thinking about tents and camps, beans or cans of beans aren’t the first things you think of or maybe you don’t think of them at all. But a famous beans brand wants you to actually want to stay in a giant bean with wheels when camping in national parks. And of course, eat their beans.",
            "Designer: Bush’s Beans",
            "Bush’s Canper is a promotional idea for the family-owned bean company and they’re offering some lucky campers a chance to stay in the “fully stocked giant bean can on wheels” and stay in one of their three parks partners: Big Bend National Park in Texas, Grand Teton National park in Wyoming, or Great Smoky Mountains National Park in North Carolina and Tennessee. Aside from looking like a giant can outside, the entire camper, errr can-per, has all kinds of bean-themed design touches including beddings, posters, furniture, and of course, food.",
            "The camper also has water and power already, in case you don’t want to really rough it out when camping. It also comes with food, drinks, camping (canping) gear, and other things you will need when camping. And you also get a private chef to prepare all your breakfasts and dinners plus packed lunches for when you go explore the park. But of course, expect that most of your meals are bean heavy or at least bean-centric since they’re the sponsor after all.",
            "When you win the raffle, you and a companion get an all-expenses paid trip to the national park of their choice and a stay inside the Canper as well as all the things mentioned above. I don’t know if the bean camper is the actual incentive for people to join but hey, at least you get to say that you stayed inside a bean plus had the chance to explore the national park for free. Oh and you get to eat lots of beans too."

The iconic vehicle proudly makes its deserving place on display at the Mercedes-Benz Museum in Stuttgart-Bad Cannstatt.",
            "It’s been unheard of vehicle-powered by a warplane by the German automotive marque since then but a concept by the creative digital artist known for his cool designs, now demands attention. Color it in matte black and a Batmobile version for Matt Reeves to derive inspiration for The Batman – Part II slated for 2025 release is not out of the question.",

With this Mercedes concept design philosophy follows suit as Yasid unearthes memories of the super stretchy T80. Since he’s a fanatic of World War 2 planes, the Mercedes was the right vehicle to experiment with a fusion.",
            "A car being inspired by a WW2 plane (minus the wings) is not very common especially when not a single plane, rather quite a few of them are the influence. Yasid in a very short Instagram post says that this concept has the clear looks of a vintage fighter plane with “the canopy style greenhouse, the very elongated front end, the rear wing, and the front side exhausts.”",
            "The V12 engine of this Mercedes protrudes from the hood much like a dragster or a muscle car, lending it a very intimidating stance. That bubble canopy-like door offers all-around visibility and fluid aerodynamics while at high speeds. This canopy stays properly sealed at all times during the drive, something that a claustrophobic rider won’t fancy any given day. The tailfin acts as a rudder for keeping the car on the track and not going off the balance if somehow the traction control system malfunctions.",
            "All of this is topped off by the muscular body that curves around the middle and then again opens going to the rear. The anatomy is complemented by the silver and yellow skin, adding a dynamic character to the concept design. However, the yellow inserts on the front grille could have a more subtle fade out to go with the concept body’s fluidic nature."

            "Over the course of 120 years, air travel has undergone a remarkable transformation.",
            "Gone are the days of long flights with nothing to do except for stare outside the window as you eat your overpriced peanuts. Nowadays, passengers can enjoy perks like high-speed Wi-Fi, gourmet meals, and an endless selection of entertainment options. Yet, the quest for innovation continues. As shown by the latest patents from aerospace engineers, we can expect to see even more exciting developments in the near future. From VR-equipped seating, communal bathrooms, and robotic in-flight service carts, the airplanes of tomorrow promise to be even more incredible than ever before.",
            "These rendered versions of actual patent files from airlines and aerospace companies paint a rather vivid picture of what the future of flight could be like, for pilots, crew, and even passengers. If the future is even half as exciting, we’re definitely in for a ride!",
            "Designer: NeoMam Studios for HawaiianIslands.com",
            "Admittedly the flashiest patent file of the lot (not by a big margin, though), is this Virtual Cockpit by AirBus, which puts the pilot literally on cloud nine. With a panoramic glass facade on the front, and transparent OLED displays, this cockpit definitely feels a lot more interesting than the current kind we have. The various displays might offer a live video feed or 3D/augmented reality reconstruction of what’s outside; the 3D reconstruction could be loaded from a database and/or updated in real-time using live data. Can’t wait to try this one out in Flight Simulator…",
            "Airbus further extends this holographic technology to the passenger’s seat, with holographic infotainment systems on the front, and even on the window, letting you see your flight path against the stellar view of clouds. You might as well ditch your eye-mask at this point because there’s no way you’ll even want to sleep with this kind of information and technology at your fingertips. Author Will Self once lamented that we’ve lost our sense of awe at “being hurled by vast jet engines six miles high, then impelled down an Aeolian slalom into another time zone.” This patent by Airbus brings back that sense of awe.",
            "Business passengers tend to spend much of their time in the sky, which certainly calls for the need for a more comfortable riding experience for these premium customers. The sleek, herringbone formation of the seats optimizes space, providing ample room for business passengers to stretch out into the recess of the seat ahead. The seats are wide, rather than deep, and curve sideways like a chaise lounge to offer a way to recline and sleep without actually reclining the seat itself. Each seat is paired with a tail-shaped table of the same size, which offers enough space to store essential items underneath.",
            "While the previous patent focused on space and comfort, this one plays around with the idea of offering space in an optimized fashion. Instead of lining up seats back to back, the patent rendering shows seats placed at an angle, so as to offer more legroom by making you sit at an angle instead of straight. There isn’t much compromise in this format, thankfully, and instead of reclining, the seats slide forwards with the backrest collapsing downwards as a result to turn into a railway-style berth. It’s a privilege that Boeing only extends to its Business Class members, unfortunately…",
            "This one is reserved for the business class by virtue of the fact that it’s quite literally meant for business! Designed by Safran Seats, this in-flight meeting room is modular, allowing different configurations and meeting safety requirements. In the air, the room serves as the perfect environment for a long, important business discussion. During take-off and landing, however, partition walls can be stored away and furniture such as tables can be moved from the aisle to allow for easy access. Each seat unit has the capability to accommodate one or more passengers, with the added convenience of being able to convert at least one seat into a comfortable bed.",
            "Speaking of comfortable beds, this one from Boeing hopes to give you a better alternative to hunching over your table or collapsing on your co-passenger as you try to get through a red-eye flight. The upright sleeping system is a decidedly odd seat design that helps passengers lean forward and sleep comfortably. Sort of like emulating a massage chair, the seats come with a head pillow to rest your face in as you sleep, and a looped sleeve to rest your arms in so they don’t dangle aimlessly beside you. Doesn’t look great, admittedly, but it’s a lot better than collapsing out of your seat as you try to find a surface to lean against.",
            "If the idea of a weird contraption to sleep against doesn’t inspire confidence in you, allow me to present a future truly worth being excited about. Detailed out by Airbus, this Economy Class seating arrangement doesn’t have an infotainment system – instead, it has a dedicated VR headset for each passenger, allowing you to truly immerse yourself in a new world as you fly over your existing world. The helmets offer movies, music, and other VR experiences while also allowing you to get some privacy if you want to just sleep in them. They’re even optimized to work as air conditioning units so you don’t have sweat rings on your forehead after 3 hours of binge-watching movies.",
            "Ever found yourself on a flight that’s just taken off and you absolutely can’t wait for the refreshments trolley because you barely got to eat before the flight? To make matters worse, you’re seated in the middle of the plane, so it’s gonna take a while for the flight crew to get to you. In comes the Monorail Food Cart – a robotic cart that simply glides down the aisle to give you your food. Orders are placed electronically, ensuring the monopod has an efficient itinerary, serving everyone in good time instead of cruising down the aisle row after row and taking practically forever.",
            "I vaguely remember an airline suggesting a ‘standing section’ for passengers (it was Ryanair, I believe) to help cut costs. While that sounds like a disastrous idea, I don’t put it past airlines to think of new ways to make flying more ‘efficient’. In come the Zig-Zag seats from Zodiac Seats France. They aren’t as bad as Ryanair’s standing seats, but they do propose something weird – a bus-style seating arrangement with people facing each other to help efficiently pack more passengers into the same space. This new setup involves giving each passenger their own private space without having a co-passenger leaning against them. Everyone gets their dedicated space with leg-room, with a significant caveat of not a single seat having armrests. Sigh…",
            "All good things come to an end, and ours ends in the lavatory (quite the metaphor, I say). This communal lavatory by Boeing presents a more natural toilet arrangement where multiple people can access the facilities without having to wait in line. The lavatory comes with one outer area for washing up, and three cubicles for deploying the goods. Boeing also apparently proposes a standing urinal, although I wouldn’t want to step into that lavatory after turbulence…",

With its vertical form that has a combination of circular, oblong, and square windows and rooms, it looks like something the Minions will fit right in with. The idea for the concept is to make these futuristic buses a fun mobile school that kids will look forward to, even if what they’re going to there mostly is study while going around the city.",
            "Of course, there are a lot of practical things that you have to think about if ever this concept will become reality. The amount of energy it will take to power such a vehicle will not be something that Mother Earth will be happy about. What if the students have motion sickness? How will the bus be able to hold in place all the things that will be placed inside? Those are things that the product designers will have to think about eventually but for now, these are fun designs and maybe a vision of what mobile education will look like."

Designed as a tribute to the automotive icon’s 60-year rich legacy as well as an interesting ‘what-if’ hypothetical, these Lamborghini Performance Sneakers rather wonderfully encapsulate the company’s raging-bull design aesthetic, with an edgy piece of footwear that boasts great surface treatment and some absolutely jaw-dropping glowing details around the midsole and outsole.",

You’ve even got neon lights on the side in white and red, like the car’s headlights and taillights, along with air vents that instantly help viewers create that visual bridge between automobiles and footwear. It also helps that Almossawi’s approach to shoe design looks so radically different, that you’d almost never confuse it with your ordinary pair of kicks. After all, a Lamborghini is far from ordinary, right?",
            "The shoe’s chaotic design ties in beautifully with some of Lamborghini’s more exclusive cars (the Sián and Terzo Millennio come to mind). The shoe’s multi-panel design features the use of regular and suede leather for that premium touch, against a technical fabric with a hexagonal design for that wild, sporty touch, and even a little carbon-fiber thrown in for that signature automotive callback. Glossy plastic elements like the one on the toe tip add that rugged appeal to the shoes, while those glowing elements on the side and base make the shoe look undeniably futuristic and like they’re made for speed.",
            "The shoes are layered with Lamborghini iconography, including the company’s logo on a metal plate on the shoe’s tongue, the brand name glowing on the back, a subtle Italy flag on the front, along with the horned logo commemorating the Italian marque’s 60th anniversary.",

The car’s chassis and kinetic power of the Disus-X suspension system lend it the ability to bunny hop like a low rider on steroids – readying itself by lowering the stance a little like a predator, and then launching all four wheels off the ground. This ability is attributed to the in-house developed intelligent body control system that’s set the cat among the pigeons for established supercar makers. If that’s not startling enough, U9 can also drive for miles with a missing wheel (if you get a flat tire) thanks to its intelligent suspension system.",

If we are to believe BYD, the supercar’s battery gives it an impressive range of 435 miles on a single charge. Other than this, there’s not much revealed by BYD about the supercar, so we’ll have to wait for more information.",

Restful sleep during the night is also guaranteed with a modular arrangement that makes maximum use of space.",

            "As the mercury begins to soar and the days get longer, outdoorsy would be eager to spend more time outdoors and reconnect with nature. One great way to do this is by going camping, but not everyone wants to rough it in a tent.",
            "If you’re like me, who loves the idea of camping in a bit more comfort and above the ground, Days on Tracks from Germany has designed the Alpaca camper, which is precisely what we could rest with.",
            "Designer: Days on Tracks",
            "Dubbed DOT Alpaca, this is a stylish and versatile camping solution that fits snugly onto the back of a pick-up truck turning it into a camper. With its lightweight aluminum shell providing durable design, the DOT Alpaca is built for all-season camping.",
            "One of the most impressive features of the Alpaca is its compact size and wooden finish. Unlike traditional campers that take up the entire truck bed, the Alpaca occupies only the top half. The Alpaca soft top rooftop tent, therefore, provides a comfortable, secure space (with about 8 feet height) to sleep and relax and pairs with a queen-size bed and color-changing ambient lighting. There are window hatches for ventilation and comfort throughout the night and day.",
            "Whether you’re planning a solo adventure or a trip with your partner, the Alpaca can be customized to suit your needs. You can add off-road accessories and camping equipment like awnings to the rooftop tent to extend your living space and create the ultimate camping experience.",
            "Of course, all this comfort and convenience doesn’t come cheap. The DOT Alpaca is priced at $8,400, which might be a bit steep for some campers. But if you’re someone who has a pick-up truck and wants to convert it into a camper to explore the great outdoors without sacrificing comfort and style, the Alpaca might be worth the investment. So, why not start planning your next camping trip today and see for yourself what the DOT Alpaca can do?"

            "Access to the Dufour is through the entrance in the middle. On the left is the living area with a fireplace, on the right is the kitchen and then the bathroom. The well-equipped, modern kitchen has a stove, fridge and oven with a hood. The space is seamlessly fitted with a dishwasher and washing machine. The bathroom alongside is again fitted with necessary amenities such as an eco-friendly toilet, rain shower, and a vanity with a mirror.",

Each loft bedroom has a double bed and storage shelves, while the main bedroom has a generous skylight (if you want, you can have a skylight in the second bedroom as well)."

Electric VTOLs are making a splash, Lamborghini just unveiled another hybrid car dubbed the Revuelto, and electric scooters are truly picking up pace – not just literally, but also in terms of consumer demand. The YADEA Elite Prime is proof of this, given its exhaustive feature list that makes it a pick for any urban commuter. The Elite Prime comes with a foldable body that can be stashed away in a car boot or even carried onto the subway, and boasts of a top speed of 18.6mph, a range of 40 miles, a 1500W motor (peak power) that lets you climb inclines of up to 30%, an electronic braking system, smart features like automatic parking, cruise control, and remote lock/unlock, and for safety, self-healing tubeless tires that will always keep you moving.",

            "Every part of the Elite Prime seems consciously designed, and its slim frame and design means that the folks at YADEA used every inch of the scooter to their advantage. The e-scooter is ridiculously sleek, and comes with a folding frame that lets you cut its height by a third, making it easy to stow away in your car boot, a corner of your garage, or even under a bed or table. Made from aluminum, the frame gives the Elite Prime its appeal along with its strength and lightweight design. Aluminum also makes it corrosion-resistant, while the Elite Prime’s IPX5 water-resistant build means you can ride your scooter on wet roads and in the rain too. The entire e-scooter weighs 80 lbs, although it supports up to 265 lbs of rider weight. Within the small frame sits an electric motor that outputs a peak power of 1500W, and a 46.8VDC 14.5Ah large-capacity lithium battery that stretches your usage to a pretty commendable 40 miles (thanks in part to the e-scooter’s Energy Recovery System), while also generating enough torque to help climb inclines up to 30° rather comfortably.",

            "Give Up your Range Anxiety – One full charge on the ElitePrime can take you a full 40 miles (65km). It uses a 678Wh large-capacity lithium battery to put most round trips in the city within reach.",

It broadly sports four riding modes, ranging from a pedal-assist mode to a medium-speed mode, sports mode, and an acceleration mode that lets you hit its top speed of 18.6 mph or 30 km/h. Regardless of the mode, single-side polymer shock absorbers within the front and rear suspension systems offer better elasticity toughness and softness, helping smooth out rides on even cobbled pathways, while an advanced electronic braking system gives you precise control over your ride. A motorcycle-level headlight, taillight, and turn signals just help refine the riding experience further, providing visibility and safety in lower-light settings, and a clever Fall Prevention feature helps the Elite Prime stop running if it detects itself leaning/inclining more than 45°. The Elite Prime even comes with 10″ thickened tubeless tires that are self-healing and offer greater safety than conventional tube tires.",
            "That, however, is merely scratching the surface with the Elite Prime, which goes beyond the realm of an e-scooter and treads in smart scooter territory. A smartphone app lets you access features like remote lock-unlock for your scooter, GPS tracking, theft prevention, and even more advanced functions like cruise control and automatic parking. Simultaneously, the Elite Prime comes with its own multifunctional LED dashboard that lets you see stats like speed, riding mode, battery level, head/tail-light status, Bluetooth connectivity, and even a fault-warning to let you know your e-scooter needs a check-up. A single button on the Elite Prime also lets you toggle between modes, while regenerative braking helps boost the Elite Prime’s battery level, giving you more ‘bang for your buck’. When your e-scooter hits critical battery levels, a magnetic charger helps juice the Elite Prime’s batteries, taking it to 100% in 6-8 hours.",
            "The Elite Prime follows YADEA’s history of being a global leader in developing and manufacturing electric two-wheel vehicles including electric motorcycles, electric mopeds, electric bicycles, and electric kick scooters. The e-scooter is the culmination of years of R&D, along with YADEA having sold products to 60 million users in over 90 countries. The e-scooter boasts an under $700 price tag, providing a more powerful motor and delivering a higher range than other e-scooters in its price bracket. The Elite Prime begins shipping in May, and its companion smartphone app is compatible with both iOS and Android devices.",

E-bikes, on the other hand, have the perfect synergy of motor power and human power, but many of them fall short of going the distance without taxing the rider’s legs. Fortunately, that kind of compromise is now a thing of the past. The brainchild of Buell Motorcycle Company founder and former Harley-Davidson engineer Erik Buell, the FUELL Flluid-2 and Flluid-3 offer not only the longest ranges in the market but also provide comfort, convenience, safety, and style that will give you the confidence to traverse any road, whether for work or for adventure.",

They’re also fast, with a maximum assisted speed of 20 mph in the US (25 km/h for EU), or up to 28 mph (45 km/h EU) for the S models. And when you combine power from your feet and the motor, the Valeo Cyclee Mid Drive Unit’s whooping 130Nm of torque makes short work of uphill battles — even on the steepest of inclines. The Valeo Cyclee Mid Drive can do much more than that and is one of the most advanced e-bike systems in the market. For one, it features an integrated automatic gearbox with predictive shifting that automatically shifts to the optimal gear for a smooth and seamless experience on hilly roads. It can also predict when to make that shift by taking into consideration your speed and cadence so that you don’t have to worry about shifting gears on your own and just enjoy the smooth riding experience.",

            "According to Tue Beijer, CTO and co-founder of Stilride, “The Stilride 1 is the culmination of many years’ ambition, passion and experimentation. It has been designed for both the motorcycle enthusiast and the design and sustainability purist. We can’t wait for our first customers to experience the pure joy of our ride and join us in setting a new gold standard for sustainable electromobility.” The maker describes the e-bike as a game-changer in its competing market and is surely the “next step in the electric mobility revolution.”"

            "In the automotive design arena where herd behavior of mustering up electric bike concepts is a proven formula for garnering attention, Wu takes a detour with a gasoline-powered bike that has a detachable coffee grinder, secured water tank and dedicated storage section for a portable coffee pot. No this isn’t some stale April Fool’s Day joke, but a concept dedicated to the spirit of biking and satisfying the craving of drinking coffee.",
            "The idea of an integrated coffee grinder seems absurd but the more one thinks about it, ever so probable it seems. The dissipated heat from the growling engine is put to good use for heating up the water and brewing the perfect cup of joe – just when you’ve clocked hundreds of miles, looking for a quick coffee break. With Cafe Racer, there’s no need to search for the nearest café, it’s right there – anytime, anywhere!",
            "A café racer in the true sense, the concept motorcycle is a convenient and practical solution for riders who deem hot coffee as their holy grail. Fitting in such a complex coffee-making mechanism doesn’t in any way hinder the riding position or weight balance of the Café Racer. The designer imagines the bike in two color options – light brown with cream and black with silver. I prefer the former because of the whole theme – remember it’s centered around brewing your own cup of coffee."

The vehicle is powered by a powerful electric drivetrain and has an aerodynamic design for optimized reduction in drag coefficient to extend the total range even further. Carrying the DNA of a station wagon and adopting the elements of a sports car, the NINE has wraparound headlights and taillights to amplify the futuristic appeal.",

The front section gives up on the grille for a uber futuristic panel with the headlights hiding in design. Tail end of the concept sedan is topped by a transparent diffuser to further reduce air turbulence. While the EV seems to have a muted aero-kitted sports car aesthetic, everything is balanced well to not be overkill.",
            "The designers imagine this luxury Hyundai sedan to ride on aero-inspired four-arm wheels. Those rear ones are covered by the bodywork thereby smoothing the airflow further. That said, the most noticeable feature of NINE is the boot section which hides a lounge seat for relaxing during long, grueling journeys. This section can be revealed with the push of the buttons as the wraparound LED taillights pivot around to give way to the space."

The LEGO model is highly authentic and modular, with three different versions available (featuring two hood types), and varying features including off-road accessories and a top rack for transportation.",
            "Unlike other LEGO builds, especially from the Ideas community, the LEGO Icons series requires great amounts of research and work from LEGO’s team. For the classic Defender, LEGO’s Design Masters went to Land Rover’s manufacturing centers to study how each automobile was built. This construction process helped inform the end-result’s design, allowing LEGO to understand the chassis shape, how the steering connects to the wheels, and how the suspensions are factored into the automobile. The brick-based result wonderfully mimics the original, with iconic detailing including even the headlights which capture the Land Rover aesthetic, and the minimal overhang on the hood, which results in the front wheels practically being located inches behind the headlights. To help realize this build, LEGO even designed a new part in the form of a squarish wheel-arch, to match the arch seen on Land Rover models.",
            "In fact, the car’s build is so realistic that people apparently began referring to the actual car as a bigger version of the LEGO model. The 2336-brick model comes with a stunning amount of realism, including opening doors, an opening hood, functional steering, responsive suspension, and the choice between two incredibly realistic engine models – a V8 engine and a 5-cylinder turbo diesel. You’ve even got a working winch on the front, making the LEGO Land Rover as authentic as it gets.",

The innovative system onboard creates water from humidity in the air, while 72kWh of energy storage and 18kW of power take care of all the energy requirements. And to render the trailer capable of operating entirely off-grid, a 98-pound propane tank is also included.",

The roof slides on both sides opening up more PV panels underneath and this extension becomes an awning for the patio deck. According to the Press Release, the Living Vehicle HD lineup is expected to begin shipping in 2024 starting at about $459,995."

            "To what extent can a bike design be evolved when already thousands of iterations dot the roads, and the hyper-realistic concept design world? It can be more aerodynamic optimized for wind tunnel tests, have a better visual balance, or maybe have sharper aesthetics for dominant road presence. Perhaps a shape-shifting aesthetic is something that has not been seen much in design evolution.",
            "This is where the ATHENAS superbike draws inspiration from but for a niche set of users. Passionate bikers who at times cannot drive the best machines out there because of their short height. As crazy as that might sound, this electric motorcycle concept imagines such a set of wheels.",
            "Designer: Zhengxuan Xie",
            "ATHENA electric bike proposed for the year highlights the power of one’s inside values rather than the outside personality – thereby eliminating the jinx of superbike designs that are targeted at average height users. The mood board by Zhengxuan revolves around the “Power Inside” and transparency in thoughts. Hence, the translucent design of the electric bike, that in a way reminds me of the newly launched Nothing Ear (2).",
            "For a neutral user, the translucent material signifies the strength of the outer contour when viewed from a distance, and when the bike approaches proximity the visible mechanical parts reflect the power of inside intelligence. The highlight feature of the ATHENA is its shape-shifting ability to raise or lower the whole saddle section. Now only this, the whole module can be swapped with another one depending on the driving position and personal preference.",
            "A cool inclusion comes in the form of a graphic animation on the tank section for Start/Stop action or the representation of low-speed or high-speed in blue or red hues. For nerds, the bike’s specifications are impressive since it’s loaded with a 17.7kWh battery of 51mAh capacity. The 348-volt electric motor feeds the rear wheels for 850nm of peak torque.",
            "It goes without saying the bike’s visual appeal is luring and makes me wonder if a future Tesla superbike could adopt such a form factor."

            "The pint-sized Honda Motocompo scooter manufactured in 1981 could easily fit inside the boot of a car, and understandably over the years, there’ve been many iterations inspired by this design. Another resounding nod to the 49cc folding two-wheeler in the electrified era is the M One e-scooter.",
            "Designed by Shanghai-based startup, FELO, the electric scooter is an electric Motocompo that urban riders have been longing for so long, and finally bestowed with one. The two-wheeler made its first appearance at the ongoing 2023 Tokyo Motorcycle Show which apparently is also the 50th anniversary of the mega event.",
            "Designer: FELO",
            "The compact moped is a tad lighter than the Motocompo weighing just 82 pounds and similar in dimensions measuring 45.6 inches x 22 inches x 33.8 inches. Of course, it gets a major overhaul (for comparison’s sake) in the form of a 400-watt 1.34-hp hub motor powered by the 48V, 20-Ah Lithium-ion battery pack. Just so that you know, the battery pack has a 220VAC 50Hz outlet that can power up your gadgets or household appliances courtesy of the V2L (vehicle to load) capability.",
            "According to FELO, the M One will be able to churn out a range of 62 miles on one full charge if the rider maintains an average speed of 15 mph. Although there is no mention of the top speed yet, the e-bike could max out at around 20-30 mph on the speedometer. That’s very similar to what Motocompo could eke out, and no one’s complaining since top speeds aren’t a major talking point with such a compact set of wheels by any stretch of the imagination.",
            "The whole point of a small folding moped is to have a commuter that can make the quick trip to the local market without getting stuck in traffic or maybe driving on congested roads that aren’t big enough for a four-wheeler or even a standard bike. That novelty of folding down the handlebars, footpegs, collapsible fork and seat into the robust magnesium-aluminum body frame, allows the M One to easily be hauled in a family car or the bed of a MUV.",
            "M One’s compact form factor gives it a huge advantage in urban setups and the fact that it will hit the roads in Q4 2023 – initially in China and maybe Japan as well – makes it an even more exciting prospect. The fully electric two-wheeler will be priced at around $2,900 which is not a bad deal for times when city commuting demands compact vehicles like this one."

Despite teardrop trailers being a cheap and fancy alternative to suffice wanderlust, travel enthusiasts don’t resonate with the idea of spending their nights inside an aluminum box that lacks enough headroom, and a spacious bathroom in particular. This is where a bus home or a skoolie takes home the advantage.",
            "An ideal alternative to towing trailer, a skoolie boasts spaciousness, features plenty of room for storage, and can even be customized as per the user’s needs. Aurora is one such bus home conversion that ticks all the requisites. As big as two European tiny house, the 40-feet long, 2004 International RE-300 school bus with a DT466E engine has been successfully converted into a mobile home by a Dokata-based couple, Josh and Emily.",

            "Thoughtfully designed, it weighs 35,000 lbs and incorporates a full kitchen, bathroom and bedroom inside its robust build. However, the biggest highlight of the school bus conversion is its utilization of space that allows two fully-functional offices (with two monitor screens each) to pack inside its steel body. One of the offices is adjacent to the L-shaped kitchen, and the other one is located at the back of the bus. The office at the front end can actually be utilized as kitchen counter space too, while the one at the rear can function as a quaint working area.",
            "Facing the front home office is a white couch that can be extended into an L-shape sofa, ideal for sleeping a single guest. The home offices’ desk drawer can come out and transform the space into a nice dining table. The kitchen space lying next to the office is like none other. It is equipped with every minute item from electronics to storage sections that are required for a comfortable stay. With a plethora of wooden cabinets gracing the interior, the kitchen is also equipped with a full-size fridge, propane-powered stove and oven.",
            "Another major highlight of Aurora is its intelligent use of space. At the entrance of the bus home, you are graced by stairs and a dash that features storage compartments to house shoes and other nitty-gritty items. Even the top of the dash is being utilized as a shelf to house various items, with the likes of plant pots. Not to mention, there is a litter box for the couple’s cat that lives with them. The windows of the bus home make the space seem really open and allow lots of natural light to pass in, hence acting as a source of energy for plants too.",
            "Next, there is a bedroom that mainly constitutes a queen-size bed and features some overhead storage. The bathroom falls second to the bedroom and features a sunken shower. In addition, the bathroom door has been designed in a manner that it ends up separating the front section of the bus home from its rear.",
            "The whole build is incredibly well-planned. The duo spent two years of DIY labor on finalizing the layout, interior design and other modifications before they unveiled their stellar bus home conversion to the world. Another impressive highlight of the skoolie is its off-grid capability. Flanking three extendable awnings, the bus home features a raised roof covered in a 2,400-watt solar panel system powering the devices inside. Furthermore, there are three 40-gallon gray and black water tanks mounted within the floor of the bus helping it to stay fully off-grid for about ten days or so."

After launching a limited run of Tesla Tequila back in 2020, the world’s richest man is hawking a US$98 three-pack of GigaBier in select European countries. The limited-edition Pilsner-style beer bottle takes its design cues from the much-hyped, yet still elusive, Cybertruck and sports a gloss-black finish and glow-in-the-dark labeling. The alcohol itself is brewed in Berlin with Tesla’s exclusive strain of “Cyberhops” (does Elon even pay his marketing team anymore) and is said to have “notes of citrus, bergamot, and sweet fruit” and an ABV of 5%.",
            "The GigaBier, which definitely ISN’T a joke, comes in a pack of three, within a foam-lined black box that is undoubtedly going to give this alcohol collectible status. The three-pack retails for £79/€89 (or just under $100) and is available exclusively in Europe on Tesla’s GigaBier microsite. Strangely enough, as of writing this piece, the beer still hasn’t sold out so if you’re still waiting on the Cybertruck, just pull out your $100 pre-order deposit and buy the beer instead. At least you know this thing actually exists.",
            "In a world where Elon Musk once captivated audiences with his grandiose visions of electric vehicles and space travel, it’s somewhat fitting that his latest venture is a beverage that invites us to drink our sorrows away. After all, instead of delivering on the Cybertruck and the Tesla Roadster, Musk has spent the last three years shifting his headquarters to Texas, selling Cyberwhistles, buying and bungling social networks, and banning people tracking his private jet. So, raise your glass and toast to the GigaBier, a testament to the fact that sometimes, when life gives you lemons, just cut up a few wedges and have them with beer."

            "Yet another detail to go missing, or rather to evolve into something else, is BMW’s signature kidney grilles. While one can only assume that this M1 redesign concept is electric, Grimaud decided to merge the grilles right into the air intakes around the headlights. They’re still there, but in a way that feels more visually present than the significantly tinier grilles on the original M1.",
            "The LED-strip headlights are complemented by a similar-looking set of indicators right in front of the wheels.",
            "The rest of the redesigned M1 cleverly balances traditional details with creative futurism. The renewed design comes with the same black line cutting right through the side of the car, giving it a sense of speed and forward-moving dynamism, and there’s some similarity in the quarter-window’s design too. The rear windscreen also houses the same slatted grille as the original M1… however the entire rear feels like a complete visual overhaul, with a piercingly slim taillight that runs around the edge of the rectangular backside of the car. While the original had two BMW logos above each taillight, the redesign instead has the embossed initials BMW on the metal plate.",
            "What really makes the new M1 feel futuristic is its design and surface treatment. You’ve got a lighter, tighter form factor with razor-sharp edges and extremely thin parting lines between panels, resulting in a seamlessness that looks nothing like production cars from decades ago. The body kit gives the M1 a more low-hanging personality with a much lower ground clearance as compared to the original M1. I don’t know how to feel about that metallic paint job because, between the DeLorean, Cybertruck, IONIQ concepts, and a few other modern cars, it feels a little overdone. Maybe a white with blue accents instead?"

            "For parents and guardians traveling in cars with babies and young kids, they would of course want the best and the safest baby car seats for their charges. While there are a lot of options in the market, apparently, safety regulations have not been updated since the year 2000. That doesn’t mean designers and manufacturers haven’t been keeping up to date with all the newest technology to make these car seats safer and now we will be getting what is probably the safest and most technologically advanced product in the market.",
            "Designer: Frank Stephenson",
            "You would probably trust a designer who has worked on some pretty innovative things in the automotive industry. Designer Frank Stephenson, who has created cars like the McLaren P1, Ferrari F430, and Maserati MC12 among others, has come up with BabyArk. They are saying that this is the world’s safest and most innovative baby car seat as it is made of materials used by defense contractors and also uses advanced technology to make sure that the seat itself and the babies using it will be safe while traveling.",
            "The frame of the BabyArk is made from carbon fiber and the base has energy-absorbing steel coils. The material will be able to slow down the forward momentum in case the car suddenly breaks or gets into an accident. Meanwhile, the headrest uses anti-shock polymer D30 while the side-impact protection that the seat provides is based on the woodpecker’s plate-like hyoid bones. In the testing process, the prototype went through more than 200 crash tests to make sure it is indeed safe and sturdy. The seat will be able to fit in kids up to 49 inches and between 4 and 65 pounds.",
            "Another thing that makes this baby car seat unique is that it uses advanced technology alongside the “cutting-edge” materials. There are 14 sensors that can measure things like accelerometers and gyroscopes. It also tells you if the seat is not properly installed through the smartphone app. The BabyArk will be available by the end of May but you can already pre-order it for $990, a price that will probably be worth it if it keeps the babies and kids safe."

            "The electric bike dubbed ebii is tailored for city commuting and its USP is an AI-powered control box that learns the users’ driving habits and conditions to toggle motor assistance and gear shifting patterns. Of course, there are other innovative features that’ll propel Acer’s e-bike to be a winning proposition.",
            "Designer: Acer",
            "According to Jerry Kao of Acer, “The all-new ebii delivers on our commitment to sustainability via technology and creative design, further driven by the desire to enhance user’s mobility and experiences.” Weighing just 35 pounds, the e-bike is lighter than other lucrative options on the market, making it ideal for urban living. Things like the battery status, powering on remotely, or toggling the driving modes can be monitored via the ebiiGO app – thus, giving the rider plenty of flexibility.",
            "Acer ebii comes with collision detection sensors to prevent accidents and proximity unlocking features for locking the e-bike whenever you are far away and unlocking it again when you are near proximity. There’s a radar sensor under the saddle to keep the rider aware of any vehicles approaching from behind. Built-in GPS tracker for coordinate tracking means the electric bike is safe from theft, as you can lock it remotely and access the current location.",
            "The removable 460-Wh battery housed inside the control box can be fully charged in 2.5 hours, and Acer promises a range of around 70 miles on a single charge. When you are not driving around, the battery can double as a power bank for your power-hungry gadgets, now how cool is that? On the e-bike this battery feeds the 250-W motor which can be mated to the front-wheel drive system or installed on the rear – that’s another good feature riders will surely like. This motor churns out 40 Nm (29.5 lb.ft) of torque with the ability to provide pedal assist for up to 25 km/h in Europe and 20 mph in the United States. The e-bike can reach a top speed of 20 mph which is good.",
            "E-bike’s lightweight aesthetics are attributed to the aluminum alloy frame leading to a translucent headlight section, taillights, and strip lighting for increased visibility. The headlights can automatically power on/off depending on the time of the day. Sustainability is a priority for Acer, hence, they’ve fitted 20-inch wheels encapsulated by 2.2-inch airless tires that are made out of closed-loop recyclable materials.",
            "Acer ebii will come with optional accessories including fenders and a rear rack to extend the scope use even further. The price has not been confirmed yet, and neither has a release date been announced, but if Acer can keep the price competitive, the e-bike will lure buyers given its excellent features."

This new-age CTR has the body of a Porsche 911, but not the identity of one.

The notch on top of the visor on the blue helmet seems discernibly off-center, and it seems like the purple helmet doesn’t even have a matching set of horns on its left side.",
            "Our final helmet is perhaps the most easily recognizable yet, following the Marvel helmets. Meet the Predator helmet – it looks rustic with its stony finish, rasta-futuristic with its dreadlocks, and is the kind of helmet you wouldn’t want to see in your rearview mirror… definitely not if you identify as an alien!"

As eye-catching as it looks, it’s open for further customizations, like shortening the front fork or making the bike bulkier or more embellished. “I’ve always been a fan of custom motorcycles. Since customizing motorcycles is hugely popular I thought designing one which could be customized by builder after building would be a great set for fans of Lego and Lego Technic”, Pale4 said.",

It’s got disc brakes with brake lines connecting all the way to the handlebars, a detailed dashboard, fuel tank, V2 engine, gearbox, and even a functional kickstand to have the bike parked. The black aesthetic definitely feels like a choice that works, and if Pale4 could make the headlamp and taillight work, this would be an absolute winner of a fan-made MOC.",

That “makes it a showstopper when displayed”, says Pale4, who’s currently gathered 1683 votes from the LEGO community at the time of writing this article.

The vehicle has a reinforced armored shell for the roughest situations, and the options to increase weaponry arsenal or enhance battery power when needed.",

A drag reduction configuration conceals the sideburns to cut through the dense airflow. For low-speed drives, the wings can again pop out for better balance. Motorcycle Drone should be propelled by an electric drivetrain and have a stealth presence for covert missions.

The bike’s most distinct detail remains its hyper-aerodynamic form, which is literally shaped like a bullet or teardrop to help absolutely reduce any sort of wind-resistance or drag. The bike’s form takes its inspiration from old aircrafts, with their sheet-metal exteriors, bent into shape and then riveted together. The rivets on the eZpin give the bike its retro appeal, while the rest of the aesthetic feels undoubtedly modern.",
            "A big difference between Smolyanov’s concept and the Bandit9 EVE LUX is the electric powertrain built into the eZpin. The bike’s main body remains relatively hollow (especially around the ‘fuel tank’ area), while the mass between the wheels houses the battery and the motor, which connects directly to the rear wheel. The hubless wheels give the bike its futuristic touch too, although I don’t know how I feel about that branding plate hovering in the negative space of the rear wheel.",
            "The rest of the bike is an aesthetic melange of details, from those batmobile-inspired taillights to the dual headlight design on the front that feels rather cafe racer-ish. The seat on the bike cuts right into the teardrop, creating a depression that’s comfortable to sit in, ensuring that you don’t slide off at high speeds. Plus those upward-tilted handlebars do look incredibly dope, along with those gorgeous end-fitting brakes!"

According to BMW, the peculiar addition is a “metaphor for a sustainable urban lifestyle.”",

The electric motor churns out 31 KW (42 hp) maximum output to hurl it to a respectable top speed of 50 mph in just 2.6 seconds. BMW CE 04 Vagabund Moto Concept should get around 130 km of range on a single full charge. The charging time of 65 minutes to juice up the electric battery from 0% to 80 percent, and the time can be brought down significantly with the optional fast charger.",

It gives the Airspeeder a range of 300 kilometers (118 miles) and allows it to reach top speeds of 360 km/h (225 mph) in merely 30 seconds. Arguably pretty important for a racecar, I’d say.",

It’s definitely on the bulkier side, visually, so it’s best suited for setups with a lot of literal legroom. Logitech claims the chair can easily be stowed away when not in use, but that’s easier said than done, given that the setup isn’t portable or foldable, or even discreet.

            "In addition to a slide-out compartment to accommodate bikes within the camper body, the Grid can store luggage, camping gear, snowboards, skis, fishing poles, and more. The interesting scheme of things on the outside is nicely complemented on the inside with the lively living area.",

The wet bathroom onboard features hot/cold shower and composting toilet, while the kitchen across the bathroom (separated by a sliding door) has a sink, fridge, and cooktop.",
            "To take the occupants off the grid, the Grid is powered by a 400-W solar-powered system connected to 540-Ah lithium battery. A 3,000-W inverter for pairs for additional energy requirement, while water needs are taken care of by large volume water storage.

            "A much better alternative to leaving things on your dashboard or in your glove box…",
            "Designed by Swiss-based Black Sheep Innovations, these hidden taillight drawers are absolute genius, going to show that no idea is TOO ridiculous, and no space too small to be used as storage. The Rear Light Drawers cleverly sit in a hidden area right behind your taillight. When closed shut, there’s absolutely no way of knowing that there’s anything behind there, but open the taillight and a long drawer comes cascading out, with enough linear storage for an entire minibar, camping/hunting gear, or even for objects you’d ideally like to stash away from the public eye. Even with the drawer hiding behind it, the taillight still remains entirely functional, giving you an extra bit of secret storage space with quite literally nothing to lose!",
            "Designer: Black Sheep Innovations GmbH",
            "Given the intricate nature of this custom modification, Black Sheep Innovations is limiting it to just two models – the Volkswagen Amarok and the Toyota Hilux, with more models yet to be added in the future. The storage itself can be customized based on request, allowing you to create a space that’s perfect for what you have in mind, be it a minibar, a toolkit, or a hideaway spot for important documents and valuables.",
            "The hidden drawers remain easily accessible and don’t affect your car’s functionality in any way. The taillight housing can be unhooked by pressing a secret button, causing the hidden drawer to slide out as much as you want. Depending on the design, you can either have the taillight fold downwards to reveal the drawer or have it permanently attached to the drawer and extend outwards when pulled.",
            "The mods don’t come cheap. Each kit is built to order, costing as high as 3392 Swiss Francs, or $3635 of your finest American dollars. You’ll still have to assemble it on your own, though."

Not taking the futuristic styling to unpractical realms, the electric sports bike looks ready for the showroom floors in a couple of years’ time.",
            "The two-wheeled sigma male is a result of a collaboration between California-based Zero Motorcycles and Huge Design who have their base setup in San Francisco. This is not the first time the two motorhead camps have come together. The Zero FXE which was initially a concept design turned out to be a successful production model with some cosmetic changes of course.",
            "Designer: Zero Motorcycles and Huge Design",

The bike is based on the Zero SR/S electric platform, and it eventually turns out into a streetfighter ready for some action. Obviously, both companies managed to hit the sweet spot for a futuristic electric motorcycle design. A perfect mix of clean sweeping lines and intricate detailing. The final result, Zero SR-X has an aggressive stance and the DNA of raw performance injected into its veins. That’s what you are destined to get when two passionate automotive camps come down to the drawing board for brainstorming.",
            "Huge Design founder, Bill Webb passionately talks about the creation as an attempt to “define a new sub-category for high-performance electric, something between a streetfighter and a track bike.” To achieve the script for this near-perfect build, the team adopted a balanced design approach “without sacrificing raw performance look and the mechanical appeal of high-performance motorcycles.” For this, most of the SR/S bike’s base was left untouched. Other modifications were made to make the forward-leaning ride a lot wilder and more intimidating than its donor.",
            "The sci-fi element is evident from the front-heavy silhouette accentuated by the muscular front fairing. Then it flows down to the waspish tail section from the tank cover and the tapering. To conceal the slabby look of the electric motor on the bike, Bill and his team cleverly shift the visual attention to the aesthetically sexy bodywork on the back. As all motorheads know, the biggest roadblock in marketing an electric drivetrain bike is the lack of visual appeal. Those inviting LED headlights, taillights, and bump fore of the bars having the dashboard are meticulously blended into the frame design. The inclusion of aluminum details and red outlines on the front adds pep to the bike’s appeal.",
            "Zero SR-X is all set to change the perception of performance electric bikes and the adventurous future of motorcycle production. It gets an advanced ZF75-10 electric motor and ZF17.3 lithium-ion battery. That’s enough to generate 110 horsepower and 140 lb-ft of torque. With a top speed of 120 mph and a total range of 80 miles on a single charge, the dapper motorcycle has a high probability of making it through to a production-ready version soon. Till then, Let’s bask in the sigma status of this thrilling ride!"

The facelift features a cleaner design, with a white paint job that has a bit of Nordic Polestar blended in. The headlights are narrow (think Countach but slimmer), almost making it look like the car’s looking at you with a discerning glare, and the air intakes on the front are merged together to form a mouth that looks clenched shut in silent rage… that’s until you hit the ignition.",
            "For Adivi, the project simply was about reinventing the Aventador aesthetically, so there’s little to talk about as far as performance or internals go. The rear has a bit of a retro flavor, with those taillights that are a distinct deviation from Lamborghini’s sideways Y-shaped lighting. You’ve got the slatted rear windshield that’s a modern classic now, but Adivi also included pop-up fins on each side, right above the rear fenders (better visible in the front view). Exhaust pipes emerge from between the razor-thin taillights in a decidedly retro fashion too, harking back to the Diablo days.",
            "The Lamborghini Aventador Revision is currently just a hobbyist concept from the mind of Adivi, although it does leave us wanting for more. For starters, I can’t help but wonder what the interiors would look like, and even though they’re all just renders, I really do wish someone built a custom one-off version of this, just as a hat tip to how iconic the Aventador name really is."

            "Personally, Bugatti has the most distinctly beautiful product DNA. I remember seeing the Veyron for the first time and falling instantly in love… a feeling that’s somehow sustained across a whole variety of models even up to the Mistral which debuted just last year. There’s something absolutely captivating about its design, its proportions, and its eclectic use of curves and edgy lines. However, Bugatti’s never really gone beyond the hypercar realm… which makes me wonder, what if the French automotive company made more than just hypercars? Would that DNA work well across different automotive categories? An account that goes by the name FLYBYARTIST shared these stellar AI-generated images of what Bugatti automobiles would look like in different avatars, and to be absolutely honest, it absolutely confirms my hunch. There’s something truly spectacular about the car’s visual language, and even translating it to an ATV, RV, or van doesn’t diminish its appeal. If anything, I’ll say I like it even more!",
            "Designer: FLYBYARTIST",
            "The Bugatti ATV just feels like something that a custom automobile maker absolutely needs to create. The image above (and the one further above it) show what a Bugatti all-terrain vehicle would look like, and it feels as if Mad Max were just a tad bit posh. Sure, you make some sacrifices with AI-generated images (symmetry is often the first of those), but these renders look absolutely bonkers. You’ve got a car that’s unapologetically Bugatti, featuring all the classics like the horseshoe grill and even the C-shaped pillar, but with larger tires, a reinforced chassis, and what look like monstrous air intakes right below the headlights. The first image is bordering into monster truck territory, but its ground clearance puts it firmly in the ATV camp.",
            "The next explorations we have are a little larger. Looking like RVs but made for an apocalyptic desert-city, these ones aren’t to be messed with. The image above is perhaps the most well-rendered, with a fair bit of symmetry. The AI also grasps design concepts like the C-shaped cutout near the red panel at the back, and those Chiron headlights definitely look like they belong. The RV below feels like a signature AI image. It lacks symmetry around the headlights, but the vehicle itself is rather remarkable. It’s more spacious, feeling almost like a semi-truck, although that door looks a little too high-placed for my liking.",
            "Next we’ve got a Bugatti van. What would it even be used for? Cops or paramilitary, perhaps. Although my gut instinct is to think of it as a luxury UPS-style delivery van, there’s no way I’d expect the rear of that vehicle to store something as benign as carton boxes. Bugattis are domination machines, and there’s nothing dominating about a cardboard box. I’d rather see a crew of law enforcers with riot gear sitting inside.",
            "Not all vehicles need to be trucks and RVs, some of them can be good old hypercars too! This one feels like a modern classic that combines the Bolide, Divo, and Chiron together. The one below amps things up a little more by playing with form and aerodynamics, but it makes tradeoffs in the symmetry department.",
            "Our last two explorations look at edge-cases. On the top, you’ve got a logistical truck, designed for carrying cargo, while the lower image feels like some sort of tourism vehicle with exposed sides that allow passengers to look at the city around them. The cargo truck is a heavy-set vehicle with dual rear wheels for carrying maximum load, and an armor-like design that feels like it could cut through obstacles like a knife through butter. The lower exploration, on the flipside, creates a more luxurious ambiance. Glossy black paint job, golden trims, a liberal use of red for the interiors, giving the passengers a literal red carpet treatment… this is just the kind of vehicle you’d find in a Saudi prince’s home, escorting guests from one wing of the palace to the other!",

        "segments": [
            "No, Nothing didn’t design an e-bike… this piece was designed for the LBM (Leo Brutal Motorcycle) workshop using bulletproof glass as its primary material. Named the Nu’Clear (because it’s new and clear), this unusual two-wheeler looks like nothing you’ve ever seen because while most motorcycles opt for large fairings and body parts to build character, the Nu’Clear goes the absolute opposite route by being transparent in its approach… no literally! The motorcycle concept (it obviously doesn’t exist quite yet) explores quite a few first. Not only does it use bulletproof glass in the design elements, but it incorporates glass in the load-bearing parts too, like the hubs of each wheel. Sure, the motorcycle’s chassis is still made of meta, but this unusual combination of metal and glass allows the Nu’Clear to stand out rather wonderfully. Also, extra points if you noticed that transparent fuel tank on the top that’s filled with ethanol, which the Nu’Clear runs on.",
            "Designer: Mikhail Smolyanov",
            "The Nu’Clear was designed in the Atompunk style of the 50s and 60s, capturing in the potential futuristic aesthetic of the time. Sure, a glass motorcycle is futuristic by pretty much any standard, but the use of straight lines and mild fillets (as opposed to wildly aerodynamic forms) makes it look distinctly Atompunk. Think Jetsons, which originally aired in the 60s.",
            "Although Smolyanov mentions that the Nu’Clear has the potential to be an e-bike, for his own personal experimentation, the designer decided to outfit it with a boxer engine, which emerges from the two sides, sporting fins that also are reminiscent of batteries in a nuclear reactor (reinforcing the Nu’Clear name). What’s marvelous about this design direction, is the fact that it now sports a transparent fuel tank too, letting you see the fuel inside in a way that makes a fuel-gauge absolutely redundant!",
            "Smolyanov experimented with a few versions (shown below), using a combination of chassis styles. Each variant brought a new flavor to the Nu’Clear, either revealing or obscuring parts of it. V1 had a larger fuel tank, V3 used opaque paneling at the base, and V4 opted for incredibly beautiful shallow-arched metal channels to give the motorcycle its strength and character.",
            "While the motorcycle uses bulletproof glass for a pretty sizeable chunk of the motorbike’s design, for the parts that couldn’t be made with glass, it uses different materials like metal, rubber, etc. This means the Nu’Clear isn’t entirely transparent, but for the most part, it’s sufficiently skeletal to really make it catch one’s eye when it drives down the road. However, this experience isn’t limited to passersby but to the rider too, who gets the unique experience of being able to control a motorcycle made of glass, and being able to see the components and parts within the two-wheeler in a way that’s never been seen before!"

            "Like other leading automotive manufacturers’ sustainability is at the top of Nissan’s agenda too. Reason enough for them to launch a series of vehicles at the Nissan Futures event in Yokohama, Japan from February 4th to March 1st.",
            "Our attention however is focused on one right now, the Max-Out all-electric convertible roadster. This Tron-like sports car of the future was initially just a digital blueprint more than a year ago when initially revealed. Now, finally, the two-seater Nissan has come to life for good.",
            "Designer: Nissan",
            "The core idea behind its design is to feel one with the vehicle, bringing a sense of openness by offering a very “enhanced and dynamic” driving experience every time the driver hits the pedal. As far as looks go, the futuristic appeal in the form of a digital landscape is undeniable, but the retro elements balance out the overall personality. The wheels, headlights and taillight have an 80s sci-fi character, while the rectangular front section, side profile, and the interiors have a definitive future-forward design.",
            "There’s a lot of neon blue and neon green used in the exterior and the interior to amplify that hypnotic digital landscape appeal further. The dashboard gets a wide digital screen for seamless multitasking, and the sporty yoke-like steering wheel makes me want to play Overture by Daft Punk and feel the muted electric motor of the Max-Out revving at full blast on a freeway.",
            "That said Nissan hasn’t released any information about the powertrain, electric battery or the probable range of the convertible. Nor is there any word on when this ride will hit the production lines, if it ever does. The only thing marked down y Nissan is that they will create 23 electrified models by 2030 for motorheads – 15 of them will be fully electric. Also, they have a serious vision of a 50 percent electrification mix along with the Infinity brands in the ending phase of the decade.",
            "So, we are looking at a probable situation where the elements of Max-Out will be in some way or another other implemented in a production version. Still, it is good to imagine we’ll have roofless electric cars with steering wheels and normal aesthetics – not something that’s straight out of a creative designer’s pipedreams!"

            "You can only know the limit of possibility when you attempt the impossible. However, it may require you to swim against the tide or attempt a complete transformation of what is considered a norm. Jozeph Forakis, and his strategic design agency, tread the thin line of distinctiveness with the introduction of the world’s first 3D-printed superyacht. It is envisioned with a multitude of sustainability features and “Tree of Live” as its centerpiece.",
            "Forakis has conceived the 88M Pegasus as the superyacht of the future. With a layout that renders it completely invisible floating on water, it operates completely emissions-free. The two aspects have left the luxury yacht industry with a gaping mouth in awe.",
            "Designer: Jozeph Forakis",
            "The yacht is planned with a glass structure embedding transparent solar panels, which take care of power needs, and reflect the water to help the yacht camouflage with it. The construction will be handled in a never attempted format: the process would involve robotic 3D printing to devise a strong but lightweight mesh-like superstructure and hull.",
            "This construction process will ensure the use of lesser material, energy, time, and waste compared to traditional yacht-making techniques. So in addition to producing zero carbon emissions during operation, the Pegasus, will also have a minimal possible carbon footprint in manufacturing and delivery.",
            "Forakis has conceived the yacht on a beach in Koufonisia island, Greece. Explaining the objective behind the idea, Forakis said, “I was inspired to create a yacht as close to the sea and nature as possible, made of clouds floating above the waterline. I wanted to honor nature by blending into it, becoming virtually invisible.”",
            "The 88M Pegasus is unique in more ways than we have discussed. The solar-powered concept even attempts to add more sustainability with the idea to convert seawater to hydrogen (using solar energy) to run the vessel for longer. The hybrid model uses fuel cells to convert H2 into electricity which can be stored in Li-ion batteries onboard.",
            "The aft accommodates an open beach club with an oversized jacuzzi. The forward pool club has an aquarium-esque lap pool and horizontal windows that open to become balconies. When closed, the pool functions as the onboard helipad. Expected to see the light of day by 2030, the conceptual superyacht’s sustainable nature is also carried to the interiors where a ‘Tree of Life’ rests as a centerpiece in the yacht’s hydroponic garden that will ensure fresh food and clean air to the occupants."

You’d probably have to carry a portable seat along, but there is enough area in the shower room to set it up. This space can even be used as a mud room to clean up equipment before stepping into the living section.",
            "To make room for adults to stand and walk comfortably within the camper, the BR75 comes with an optional pop-up roof. By popping the roof up, you create more headroom, ensure more ventilation, and make space for pull-down double bed. The entire camper is stuffed with ample storage space but you will miss the kitchenette facility here. The flooring is dirt and scratch resistant and the interior is tastefully done in wooden finish.",

The Hilux camper is available in Japan in two variants: ¥10,980,000 ($84,000) and ¥12,450,000 (approximately $95,000)."

            "Designed as a fully autonomous vehicle, the DKM 2.0’s visual aesthetic immediately stands out as unique. Its silhouette looks nothing quite like any other car. It isn’t as maximal as a sports car, or as minimal as today’s electrified SUVs. Instead, it’s a fusion of the two, relying on multiple forms stacked on one another that have been merged and simplified. The car features a unique interior with seating designed more like a room than a car. Seats face each other, creating a cabin on wheels that allow passengers to socialize with each other as the car autonomously moves forward. The concept ditches the steering wheel and dashboard entirely too, in a bid to imagine what fully-autonomous vehicles can and should look like.",
            "Designer: Vladislav Semenov",
            "The car’s design comes from Kazakh automotive stylist Vladislav Semenov. As far as its references go, it seems like the DKM 2.0’s most notable inspiration comes from vision conceptual automobiles, combined with the realistic design of companies like Rivian, Canoo, and Polestar. There’s a level of purity in the use of silver and black, and those headlights look clean and futuristic as heck. However, the upper and lower halves of the car are designed in a staggered way that instantly draws the eye. The front of the car features a flat-ish panel where you’d expect the radiator grill, with the front fender emerging outwards, almost like shoulder blades. This probably helps guide air into the car’s intakes on each side, while the top has that razor-thin headlight, and then the ‘windscreen’ that emerges almost like an independent entity.",
            "This unique stepped design provides an interesting visual, since it causes an obvious break in the surface, but it’s also where I suspect all the car’s sensors are housed. The stepped/staggered design can be viewed on both the front and the back, housing all the sensors, while the cockpit sits in between, and has what I imagine is a glorious view on both the sides as well as the top thanks to panoramic windows that extend all the way from the middle of the doors right to the top. Alternatively, the top can be used to place a cargo box (given that the amount of boot storage in this car hasn’t quite been made clear yet), which may obstruct your view a tad bit, but it’s a small price to pay for extra cargo.",
            "The DKM 2.0 wasn’t designed for city roads. Its large build, high ground clearance, and rugged tires indicate that the car’s made for all sorts of terrain, be it urban or otherwise. As most SUVs and pickups go, the DKM 2.0 probably boasts a large range too, allowing families, friends, and colleagues to go on road trips without worrying about how to get places. The fully autonomous feature makes road trips easy and more fun, also giving you the possibility to break open a few beers on the way without worrying about having a designated driver!"

Personal ownership of transport is great for society, but not so much for the actual environment our society exists in. However, it’s difficult to shake the notion that bigger, more expensive cars make you look like you belong to a certain stratum of society. For Marko Petrovic, designer and founder of MarkDesignStudio, the answer was simple – to make luxury environment-friendly, just blur the line between luxury and utility. People will love to use public transport if it looked great and was branded with the insignia of Audi, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, or any other brand. If the only barrier to the mass adoption of public transport was just that private cars looked better and felt more premium, the solution was obvious. Make public utilities look and feel amazing!",

While transportation exists on three mediums – land, air, and water, Petrovic’s concept focuses predominantly on land, but can easily be carried forward to other areas of transport. The people and planet stand to benefit simply through the combination of creating an efficient public utility service that the public would love to use. The Concept NTU seats six in a transparent pod that’s transported around on an electric platform powered by solar energy. This pod concept efficiently utilizes space by ensuring that it never travels empty, and uses fixed routes, almost like a tram or railway system, creating a powerful centralized utility service that runs on clean energy. How does Profit factor in? Well, these transportation pods are directly created by brands, which focus not on personal ownership but on public service. Brands can further expand their offerings by providing personalization packages for the car’s experience and the UI.",

The engine arms wirelessly pull energy from nearby electric power stations, but it goes even further by sharing non-used energy with other power stations and NTU vehicles in the vicinity to create an efficient distributed wireless energy network.",

The signature GT4 RS origin is hinted at by the rear quarter-window intakes, feeding fresh air to the engine. 911 GT3 R elements are also apparent in the small splitters supported by cables and vents at the trailing edge of those 21-inch magnesium wheels.",

This reminds me of the brand’s Mission R EV race-car concept introduced back in 2021. Circuit racing personality is visually present in the form of “75” number decals on the door and hood, and “357” stickers on the front fenders and rear fascia. There are “Air” decals, and arrows pointing to the inlets and air intakes which are unique in their own rights. The roadster adorns dual-tone Ice Grey Metallic and Grivola Grey Metallic hues which are inspired by the factory shades of the 1950s.",
            "The elements that hint towards its core concept DNA are the rounded headlight motifs and the subtle rear lights. All this leads me to believe it’s not going to be a production version anytime soon and only be restricted to being an eye-candy racer. Passionate Porsche fans can see the Vision 357 concept at a special exhibit in Berlin until mid-February, and later on at international automotive events later this year."

No wonder such boats with this tech are currently very rare, since they lift over the waterline at certain speeds to reduce drag and friction. Just imagine, the amount of thrust required for the foil cant systems to lift the movable arms without creating any complications.

This promises comfortable sea traveling for pan-continent journeys, unlike anything we’ve seen so far. For the opulent guests, there’s more than enough room for a luxurious stay and a huge sundeck for baking in the sun. There are four main levels, six guest cabins housed in the body and an expansive shipowner suite.

The building’s roof was constructed using heat-treated pine, and in a rhythmic and repetitive fashion, that is inspired by boat craftsmanship and the flow of water. The panels of the facade are arranged in an interesting pattern that mimics the shapes of kayaks.",
            "“The chosen wood structure is from both the outside and the inside inspired by the rich culture of boat craftsmanship. The thermo-heated wood is reflecting the original deeply Nordic-rooted material for boat construction. It will turn grey in a few years,” said Foray.",
            "The pine cladding was selected not only because it will eventually grey with time, but also because this material is used very frequently in the construction of boats. The interiors were designed to give  “the impression of being under a boat turned upside down”. Even the materials for the interiors were selected in accordance with this brief. Originally, the Esbjerg Maritime Center was supposed to open in 2022, although a bit later than its intended deadline, the space is finally open to the public!"

            "Collaborating with the ABB FIA Formula E World Championship (the official motorsport world championship for EV’s), Beta Design Office has revealed the latest trophy for the Formula E series. The trophy takes on the appearance of a torch, but in fact is a call-back to the power features of the GEN3 – the third-generation Formula E car. Its circular profile is an obvious hat-tip to the wheel, referencing the spokes found on the hubs along with an overall form that represents a ‘burst of energy’.",
            "Designer: Beta Design Office",
            "Formula E commissioned Beta Design Office to create an iconic new trophy for the GEN3 era, with the brief being to convey electrification, speed, and movement while maintaining elegance and modernity.",
            "Designers at Beta drew influence from components of the world’s first all-electric motorsports championship to create a trophy with 44 fins. The 22 larger fins symbolize the 22 drivers in Formula E and the 22 smaller fins represent their vehicles on the track. In conceptualizing the award, the designers took cues from automotive spokes, heat sinks and power cables, as well as elements of car body panels that evoke graceful motion.",
            "The 1st place trophy is the largest of the three, and is colored in a deep golden, while the 2nd and 3rd trophies look identical with their similar size and silver color-finish.",
            "“Formula E commissioned Beta to design and engineer the new trophy to coincide with the debut of Formula E’s new GEN3 race car – the fastest, lightest, most powerful, and efficient electric race car ever built”, the press release mentioned. “The first electric open wheel race car to break 200mph, the GEN3 acts like a power station on wheels, generating more than 40% of energy used in the race during the race itself, and more than doubling the regenerative capability of the previous GEN2 car to 600kW.”",
            "The trophy debuts right in time for Formula E Season 9, which begins with the first race this Saturday 14th Jan in Mexico City."

This is the brain-child of a Milan-based motorbike photographer and director who doesn’t have any expertise in mechanics or aerodynamics, just a deep-rooted love for watching vintage motorbike racing from the early 1900s.",
            "Designer: Valen Zhou",
            "The form of this bike dubbed “Sprinter” is purely based on Valen’s imagination who wanted to create a board racer crossed with a drag bike. Things look raw upfront with the handcrafted steel frame, bicycle saddle and custom dropped bars confirming the raw character. At the heart, Sprinter is powered by a Kawasaki KZ250 engine (generating just 20 Nm of torque) and those crazy-looking suspensions are purely sketched by imagination, not necessarily backed by engineering feasibility. The petite seat too seems very uncomfortable, virtually curling up the rider in a fetal position.",
            "Valen feeds the engine off a swappable 17 oz aluminum bottle mounted at the bottom to propel the Sprinter forward. Frame of the bike is encapsulated in exhaust pipe tape, and connected to a custom suspension setup on the front and the aft. On closer inspection, the bike handlebars have custom-built throttle mounted with gears and a reverse clutch level. Of course, braking is important, so the hardcore bike gets a single brake disc salvaged from a motocross bike. This all suggests, the serendipity track racer is made for lopping dirt tracks where braking is not that important. The Sprinter has a hub-steering set up to keep the raw racing element alive.",
            "Ultimately the idea is to keep total weight to the bare minimum and not sacrifice agility as far as possible. Would I want to take this dirt racer for a spin on tracks? I’d be reluctant to do that since Valen himself is not sure if this one will adapt to the roads as intended."

            "Although the public demonstration got called off due to dicey weather (thanks, polar vortex), NFT Inc. (not the crypto kind) was all set to reveal a fully-functional prototype of their ASKA eVTOL at CES this year. Armed with FAA and EASA certifications, the ASKA A5 is arguably the world’s first ‘street-legal’ eVTOL that can alternate between driving on a highway or flying in mid-air. I’d argue that given its design, you’d probably do a spit-take if you saw this massive machine cruising right beside you on the road.",
            "“Our unveil at CES represents something that has never been accomplished in the world, but which humans have dreamed of for decades: a fully functional, full-scale prototype of a Drive & Fly electric Vertical Takeoff and Landing, a real flying car. We’re making history with ASKA™ and defining the next 100 years of transportation,” mentioned Guy Kaplinsky, CoFounder/CEO.",
            "Designer: NFT Inc.",
            "For the uninitiated (we wrote about ASKA back in 2021), the ASKA A5 is a car, eVTOL hybrid that can alternate between driving down roads or taking off and gliding through the air. The vehicle, which seats 4, sports a rather unique framework, featuring fold-out wings with rotors mounted on them. In-wheel motors give the ASKA A5 a top speed of 70mph when cruising in ‘car mode’, while offering better traction and aerodynamics, while existing outside the eVTOL’s fuselage for a maximized cockpit. However, if the idea of gridlock doesn’t sit well with you, the ASKA A5 transforms into an aerial vehicle in mere minutes. The ASKA A5’s wings unfold and its propellers arrange themselves in a hexagonal pattern, while the car dashboard inside transforms into an information-rich cockpit with maps, gauges, and meters. Once airborne, it can reach speeds of up to 150mph with a range of 250 miles on a full charge – not to mention built-in safety protocols for safe landings. However, you can’t really decide to take off in the middle of a highway – you still need to abide by FAA regulations by having a piloting license and using helipads or vertiports for taking off and landing. We still live in a civilized society, right?",
            "A few more details have emerged about the ASKA A5, including its proprietary power system that features lithium-ion battery packs and a gasoline engine that acts as an onboard range extender. The ASKA A5 can take off in both ways, in a vertical fashion like a helipad, or even on a runway, which apparently is much more energy efficient. “In the U.S. alone, there are around 15,000 airfields with runways,” explains Maki Kaplinsky, CoFounder & Chair/COO. “Our innovative engineering enables ASKA™ to take off from a runway super fast using our unique in-wheel motor technology. This is a revolution in aviation, enabling ASKA™ to take off in less than 5 sec with a runway of 250 ft which brings the closest experience to an F-18 Super Hornet fighter jet taking off from an aircraft carrier for our customers”",
            "On the timeline front, not much has changed for the ASKA A5. The company is still looking at a 2026 launch, which seems incredibly commendable considering the chip shortage and the looming pandemic that’s somehow still wreaking havoc in countries like China well into its fourth year. The eVTOL is up for preorder if you’ve got $5,000 for a downpayment on the $789,000 vehicle. It has roughly the same footprint as a large SUV, so if you’ve got open-air parking, you could totally have this sitting right beside your home. I’d probably make a risky bet that this will actually begin shipping before the Cybertruck."

            "While in theory, the Atmos Gear feels like a winning idea, they’re about as game-changing as the hoverboard, i.e., they’ll probably exist as just a niche product.",
            "The Segway and Hoverboard had pretty much the same instant appeal to their respective demographics when they launched, but they weren’t really what they promised to be – the future of transportation. The owner of the Segway company also pretty ironically died when his Segway drove off a cliff. Emblematic? Maybe. However, morbid news aside, a new company by the name of Atmos Gear really grabbed eyeballs at CES this year, with journalists zipping around on their electric skates. The skates, which look like your average pair of inlines and are connected by wires to a sling bag that houses the battery pack. A handheld remote lets you control your skates, which can hit speeds up to 25km/h with a range of 20 kilometers on a full battery charge. Needless to say, they can be used as regular skates even when the battery’s depleted.",
            "Designer: AtmosGear",
            "What’s notable about the gear is the fact that it isn’t an entire unit. The AtmosGear can essentially be attached to any pair of inline skates by simply swapping out the analog wheels for the electric ones. The skates can be used without the electric motor being powered on too, as I alluded to earlier, although the presence of cables running from your feet all the way up to the battery pack in your sling bag feels like it could really become a hindrance.",
            "So what makes the AtmosGear skates so special? Well, the skates come with two operational modes – a remote-controlled mode, which lets you use the handheld controller to accelerate, slow down, or brake, and secondly, the smart assistance mode, which I believe is the more interesting of the two. The smart assistance mode works just like a pedal-assisted e-bike. You skate as you regularly would, and the electric motor automatically kicks in to amplify your skating with lesser human effort or intervention. If AtmosGear figures out a way to do all this without the currently-clunky cable and sling bag system, this may just be a literal game-changer.",
            "This is just the beginning of the road for French startup, AtmosGear. There will obviously be newer versions with better technologies, but for now, the skates they debuted at CES seem to be their flagship product, and are also available on their website for preorder. The company has taken orders for 150 pairs so far and is aiming for 200 orders to start production. “My goal is for everyone to go skating again because it’s so much fun, every time you see people skating you see them with a big smile,” said AtmosGear founder, Mohamed Soliman."

A good example is toggling the handlebar section for racing or city riding configuration. This will give motorbike enthusiasts the flexibility of having different two-wheelers for a specific purpose without having to buy a new one. The swapping will be effortless and as easy as changing a toddler’s diaper.",

Each wheel has its own motor, brake, and gearbox, and the REE XBW’s drive-by-wire, brake-by-wire, and steer-by-wire technology replace mechanical or hydraulic systems with electronic ones. This means you can design a bus with a steering wheel placed practically anywhere, giving it a sort of flexibility that other EVs don’t possess.",

The bus’ design is a visual palindrome – it’s exactly the same on the front as well as the back, which means it can flip directions on command, traveling in reverse if needed. The bus’ drive-by-wire technology means the steering wheel can potentially be shifted from the front to the back too, helping it reverse orientation without doing a complete U-turn. Even if it did need to do a U-turn, the XBW has a ridiculously small turning radius, thanks to the fact that its wheels can independently face in any direction, helping the large vehicle make sharper, shorter turns at corners and around objects.",

The EV’s IWD and x-by-wire features give it unparalleled vehicular stability, responsiveness, and safety. This helps the XBW concept run flawlessly on roads, with the agility of a much smaller vehicle and the ability to overcome bad roads, tricky turns, and even slippery surfaces with relative ease.",

All cars have the same wheelbase, but have chassis and track modifications based on the car type.",
            "This entire process does to cars what standardized parts did for smartphones. Almost every smartphone runs on Android, but uses its own version/variation of it. As is the case with the processor, display, and camera modules. U Power’s standardized electric skateboard makes creating your own automobile easy too. Companies can build and modify concepts, experimenting with forms, aerodynamics, and interiors without having to focus on the underlying electrical and electronic components that actually power the EV. Moreover, they can make their own modifications to the platform too, getting the most out of it.",

            "It seems that Zectron’s figured out something most other bike companies haven’t. Simply attaching a motor and battery to a bicycle fulfills the bare minimum requirements, but to go the distance, the actual distance, you need to create a bike that’s smart enough to know when and where to conserve or release energy. With a 350W motor capable of 20mph, an algorithmically optimized battery with a 150-mile range, and a foldable frame that lets you store the e-bike in the trunk of a car, the Zectron e-bike is designed to be the best of all worlds. It’s comfortable to ride on any terrain, comes with multiple riding modes and pedal assist levels, and boasts of a battery that lasts for an entire week thanks to the algorithms that constantly optimize the Zectron’s ride in real-time to give it its staggering 150-mile range.",

            "The origins of the Zectron e-Bike seem surprising – the company was founded more than 60 years ago by renowned American toy maker Wham-O. Its first product was the humble superball, a tiny ball capable of bouncing 5x higher than balls double its size. The spirit of innovation led the company down a rather specific path, making it a force to be reckoned with in the mobility sector, and roughly half a century later, the Zectron e-bike was born. The e-bike’s unique design and build boast of an incredibly stellar range in a deceptively small form factor for an affordable price – the feature trifecta that other e-bikes struggle to nail down.",
            "Two-step Easy Folding – Easily fold up the Zectron bike with just 2-steps for easy storage and carry it on any adventure.",
            "Maximum Comfort Suspension – The dynamic rear suspension keeps the ride comfortable and their anti-shock technology ensures a cloud-like riding experience.",
            "Suspended Seat – Feel the instantaneous response of the ultra-shock absorbency from their interpretation of the seat-stay that suspends the saddle to soak up any jolts from the road giving you a smooth effortless ride.",
            "The secret sauce to the Zectron is a combination of factors that make the bike greater than the sum of its parts. It comes with a foldable magnesium alloy frame that reduces the e-bike’s form factor to nearly a third of its original size. Couple that with the fact that the entire vehicle weighs just 55 lbs (24.9 kilograms), and you’ve got an e-bike that’s easy to carry around with you on the subway, fit in an elevator, or even stash in your car’s boot when not in use. Once folded open, though, you’ve got a comfortable e-bike with a clean design that cleverly hides all its electronic hardware and wires. The e-bike has an adjustable seat that sits right above the dynamic rear suspension, giving you a ride that feels comfortable no matter what terrain you’re on (thanks to that anti-shock technology that gives you a ‘cloud-like’ riding experience), while the ergonomically designed e-bike is designed to accommodate a wide range of riders as tall as 6’5″/195cm, and weighing up to 297lbs or 135kg. A built-in dashboard lets you easily access the Zectron’s multiple riding modes.",
            "Three Riding Modes – The Pedal-Only Mode gives you full control of the pedaling allowing for a good exercise. The Pedal-Assist Mode offers power assist while pedaling ease your biking experience on all kinds of terrains. Or go with Throttle-Only Mode and enjoy riding without a sweat.",
            "Fine-tuned as One – The battery, controller and motor are optimized algorithmically working in synergy to allow riders to enjoy a long range.",
            "The dashboard lets you toggle between the three riding modes on the Zectron. You can either opt for a full-pedal experience (akin to your everyday analog bicycle), a pedal-assisted mode where the motor supplements your riding (with 5 levels of assist to choose from), and a throttle-only mode where the motor takes over a 100% of the riding experience – a feature that’s currently only available to the US audience. The full-throttle mode lets you choose your riding speed too, with a lower-end Eco setting capping off at 10mph, a Normal setting of 15mph, and a Sports setting that lets US riders reach speeds of 20mph. The settings affect the bike’s overall range, although with optimal use, the Zectron’s battery gives you 70 miles of range. However, pair it with the modular external battery that integrates right into the hollow space on the e-bike’s frame and suddenly your range gets doubled to 150 miles, thanks to the two batteries that work in conjunction with one another and are optimized by the Zectron’s expert algorithm.",
            "Other features on the Zectron include the powerful headlight and taillight that work well in the dark, a 7-level Shimano gearbox for a comfortable pedaling experience both on flat roads or inclines, and an add-on anti-theft and GPS features that keep your bike safe and prevent it from ever being stolen.",
            "The Zectron comes in multiple colors, although the metallic iridescent and chameleon colorways are personal favorites. Customers in the EU can grab their own Zectron with a 250W Bafang motor (as per EU guidelines), while US customers are treated to a 350W Bafang motor variant with the added throttle-only feature. Each e-bike ships with a 1-year warranty and local after-sale servicing both in the US and EU. The extra battery pack and anti-theft GPS are both add-on features and enthusiasts can even grab a Zectron Smart Helmet as an accessory, with its own built-in rear light for extra night-time rider visibility!",

            "Taking Berlin as an example of food deliveries in a safe and healthy manner for the delivery personnel is the motive of this student project. Another major consideration is the need for dedicatedly designed cargo two-wheelers for food deliveries in the modern age. For the most part, such food deliveries are made using regular bikes or electric bicycles in the city.",
            "This is D-VIL e-bike concept that takes into account every aspect of food delivery in cities. Things such as the need for riders/corporate offices, big companies, repairability, durability, recyclability and robustness. Some inherent problems with delivering food in crowded cities include the size of the bike, its agility while carrying stuff like bottles or heavy groceries, the need to constantly look at the phone for directions, and at times inclement weather conditions. All this creates a feeling of uneasiness and danger in the subconscious of the delivery person.",
            "One undeniable disadvantage is constantly carrying backpacks in case there is no attached storage box with the vehicle. This can lead to long-term health problems. Other than that, it creates a restriction in traffic and hampers the driving experience. Add to all these problems the pressure of delivering things on time and the whole thing feels like a herculean task every single time around. Battery-powered D-VIL to an extent aims to get over all these problems with its array of the control panel, lights and cameras, and dedicated luggage compartment.",
            "The glass roof on top provides protection from unpredictable weather conditions without losing out on the feeling of airiness while driving. For better stability, the rear wheel is a combination of two wheels joined together with a swingarm module, reinforced by an impressive suspension. Overall, the electric cargo bike has a more modern feel to it, just look at that driving panel and interior upholstery."

Meet the 928 E concept, a punkish EV inspired by classics like the DeLorean, but with a distinct Porsche DNA. Look at the silhouette and it looks pretty much like a part of the 928 family, with a rear curve that’s unmistakably Porsche. The only real deviation in trends can be seen in the front, with the slim headlights that feel like a break in tradition, and the uniquely cyberpunkish colorway featuring a metal body with a single black band running across from the front to the top and over to the back.",
            "Designer: Youngjai Jun",
            "The Porsche 928 E was created as a design exercise to see how merging Porsche’s aesthetic with the cyberpunk theme would turn out. The results are a surprisingly harmonious combination of visual languages, although some would argue that the Porsche character gets diluted a slight bit. My main bone of contention is with those headlights, which feel a little too similar to an IONIQ than a Porsche. That being said, it would be a little bit of a stretch, but I do see a little Taycan in those headlights. The one reason why that would make some semblance of sense is because just like the Taycan, the 928 E runs on an electric powertrain.",
            "The car’s quite interesting to look at, if I don’t say so myself. Designed to look unusually eye-catching, it sports a black band running laterally, which explains the black-tinted windshield and rear shield too. To maintain the illusion of the black band, however, the car has no windows whatsoever. Clearly designed with a creative license, the doors are a single piece, with no handles, rear-view mirrors, or even windows. They merge perfectly into the car’s curvaceous body, sitting completely flush against it to create a wonderful sense of continuity – a continuity that feels even more enjoyable given the lack of windows.  I’ll be honest, I love the rear too, especially the glaring red Porsche logo that integrates with the 928 E’s taillights."

It reveals the inside to connect the users to the outside by lifting up the wing on the side up to form a pitched roof.",

It comes with moveable benches and tables and a workstation for two.

It’s like a future vision of something that Elon Musk would dare to design (if he continues with his automotive ventures) for a colonized Mars sometime a decade down the line. Oozing with the similar assuring crawling stance of Dust Tesla, the Azrael bike has a definitive Tron Legacy influence on it. Everything on this two-wheeled serpent (if I may call it) is tuned for speed and not meant for sharp hairpins – either on a circuit or city streets. The thing is meant to push the throttle on and disappear into the horizon.",

On closer inspection, the rear wheel seems glued to the outer frame somehow. However, there could be a double wishbone suspension arm hidden underneath. The front wheel has a clearly visible single suspension, giving it a cruise bike-like character, not necessarily in the looks though.",

Those Autobots logos/emblems on the front forks and adjacent to the fuel tank add a sense of affiliation to the franchise which is quite convincing.

Maintenance costs and durability take precedence here as the maker claims five decades of service. According to Munro CEO Russ Peterson, the vehicle will be affordable when it comes to replacing parts – for example, if the windscreen is broken it’ll cost around $165 to replace as compared to $1,800 on a Rivian. Currently, the vehicle positioned as a work truck is in the prototype stage with expected production to hit the lines by 2023.",

This workhorse will be powered by a centrally located single electric motor transmitting power to the four wheels. When Mk1 hits the production lines it’ll be offered in 295 hp and 375 hp output versions fed off from the 61 kWh and 81 kWh battery packs respectively.",
            "For nerds, the Scottish workhorse is capable of going from 0-60 mph in under five seconds and a top speed of 80 mph. On a single charge, the Munro monster will eat up 190 odd miles before needing a replenishing dose. The EV charges in around 3.5 hours via a 22kW AC outlet and that time can be brought down to 30 minutes with a DC fast charger.",
            "Obviously, off-roading will be the truck’s USP aided by the 18.9 inches of ground clearance and 31.5 inches of wading depth. The approach angle of 84 degrees, 51 degrees departure angle, as well as 31.6 degrees break over angle, will attract extreme off-roading enthusiasts who don’t mind treading down uncharted territories. Munro Mk1 is all set to hit the American continent with an estimated price tag of $60,000.

In Formula 1, the use of the Kinetic Energy Recovery System (KERS) has found a way to conserve energy produced by F1 cars braking at over 250mph. The excessive amount of heat generated with the car brakes is harvested by KERS to redeploy it into the car for performance advantage.",

Yeah, the magnetic disc attaches to the wheel of a bike and the charger clips into it. The disk follows the wheel rotation, accumulating energy.",
            "It continues to move by inertia when the brakes bring the wheel rotation to a halt (thanks to the attached weight) to allow the accumulated kinetic energy to be transferred to the induction coil of the connected charger. The charger stores this electrical power until it is connected back to its storage which passes the energy to the public power grid.",

The supplied disks are meant for 26” and 29” bike wheels. A biker can visit the nearest storage box, clip on a disk and charger (pulled from the storage using a mobile app) and ride away, collecting electrical energy on the way to college or while returning from the grocery store.",

The motor sits against the rear wheel; couple this with the Revenant’s long wheelbase (1,212mm) and chainstay (448mm), and you know that this bike was designed for the thrill of riding with the wind in your hair. Cadence sensors built into the pedals allow the motor to kick in the minute you begin riding (with an option to upgrade to torque sensors for a more natural riding experience), and dual suspension turns everything from city tarmac to uneven roads, moderate trails, and even staircases into smooth sailing. While the Revenant isn’t designed for heavy trail work, Nireeka’s founders Max and Younes Shojaie say it serves rather well as a commuter/mountain bike thanks to the Bafang motor, Shimano Alivio 9-speed drivetrain, Anti-locking braking system, and mid-fat tires.",

            "Enough about the technical details, though. The Revenant, first and foremost, is an affordable e-bike that oozes desirability. The e-bike’s design comes from co-founder and CEO Max Shojaie, an award-winning designer in his own right. The first thing that captures your eye with the Revenant is its frame, made entirely from carbon fiber, and with an edgy aesthetic that’s dominated by straight lines, angular transitions, geometric cross sections, and tight fillets that give the Revenant its cyberpunk appeal. The broad frame houses a removable Samsung battery with an 840Wh capacity, giving the Revenant a solid 50 miles (85 km) of range under regular conditions. With a standard 4A charger, you can juice the battery from 0% to 100% in roughly 6 hours, or overnight.",
            "Fast, Stable and Safe – With its long wheelbase (1,212mm) and chainstay (448mm), this bike is made for speed.",
            "Suspension – With Nireeka’s custom-made front suspension fork and X-Fusion O2 rear shock, you have 140mm travel both front and rear.",
            "ABS Brakes – One of a few companies using the ABS (Anti-lock braking system) on the bicycle.",
            "Torque Sensor/Speed Sensor – The torque sensor senses the force you’re applying to the pedals, so the motor provides the appropriate torque based on that.",
            "Display – The Revenant HMI with a high-contrast LCD display delivers all important information at a glance and can also be read in direct sunlight without difficulty.",
            "Taillight – The embedded taillight is equipped with a Gyro sensor to light up the brake lights when applying the brakes while the running daytime light is always illuminated to help you to be seen during day and night.",
            "Battery – 840Wh battery with Samsung cells. One of the longest ranges in the e-bike industry.",
            "For its price, the Revenant may just be one of the most affordable e-bikes to boast of ABS. Available as a $300 option, riders can opt for front-wheel ABS, powered by Blubrake. The ABS unit sits outside the frame, a design direction that Shojaie went for because he wanted to highlight it rather than hide it away in the frame. The ABS, in short, prevents wheel locking and increases stability. “Bicycles are, by nature, less stable than four-wheeled vehicles”, say the folks at Nireeka. The ABS “reduces [the e-bike’s] total stopping distance”, providing a much more reliable experience while braking as well as steering. The Revenant also comes equipped with a bright taillight and brake lights that use gyro sensors and signals from the brakes to shine when you’re slowing down or stopping abruptly. For riders, there’s also the choice between a default LCD dashboard on the front and a higher-contrast TFT display with a larger screen, available as a $99 upgrade.",
            "The Revenant’s balance between great design, great features, and great pricing is the result of years of work on Nireeka’s part. The company’s been incredibly receptive to feedback from customers over the past 5 years, who’ve always wanted a bang for their buck. “I’m very proud of this design, I think it’s perfect. We’ve had a good amount of time to test this bike, too[…] We’ve been riding it since February, and testing it for a few months now in Canada”, says Max Shojaie. The Revenant is available for preorder in 3 sizes and in white, blue, and red color variants across regular or pearlized finishes, as well as a matte black variant that definitely stands above the rest. The e-bike is priced at a discounted $2,363 USD for the 1000W motor variant, with a lifetime warranty on the carbon fiber frame and a 1-year warranty on the parts and components. Deliveries begin as early as February 2023.",

        "segments": [
            "While the Cybertruck is still a conceptual vehicle, we thought we’d up the stakes and imagine what a Tesla Cyberbike would look like!",
            "Looking sort of like the Tesla Cyberquad’s meaner older sibling, the Cyberbike comes with the same edgy, angular metal fairing that houses Tesla’s game-changing electric powertrain underneath. However, this isn’t an official Tesla concept, heck it isn’t even a fan-made one. These conceptual images (there are a bunch of them below) were designed primarily using Midjourney’s Text-to-Image AI. I simply described the Tesla Cyberbike to the AI bot and was greeted by some rather phenomenal-looking images of an edgy, low-poly e-bike with a broad, aggressive body made primarily of sheet metal. The AI experimented with other aspects of the e-bike too – no two headlights look the same, and some of the tires seem rather angular as well, but the results make two things abundantly clear… that A. Artificial Intelligence is an incredibly powerful creative tool, and B. Someone should really build these out because they look absolutely BONKERS.",
            "Designer: Midjourney (Prompts by Sarang Sheth)",
            "These images are courtesy Midjourney’s latest V4 upgrade, which now allows users to use images in their text prompts. I simply selected a few minimalist bike designs and told the AI to expand on it by creating an ‘electric motorcycle inspired by the Tesla Cybertruck’. For the most part, the AI did a pretty remarkable job of understanding how angular the Cybertruck’s design is and superimposing that on the ‘Cyberbike’, but the one thing the AI currently lacks is consistency. Each image is of a ‘new’ bike that doesn’t look quite like the other concept. If anything, this article is more of a moodboard for what a Tesla Cyberbike should look like. If Franz von Holzhausen (Tesla’s lead designer) is reading this, here you go! You’re welcome!",
            "The bike concepts have a few things in common, they’re all rather broad, with an imposing silhouette that makes them feel more like a superbike than your average e-bike. Those thicc-AF tires reinforce that idea too, although some concepts make the tires just as edgy and sharp as the Cyberbike’s fairing itself. Giving the AI a cyberpunk theme resulted in a few interesting variants with some beautiful headlights (all LED strips) and some concepts like the one below even put lights in the tires, making the e-bike look like something out of Tron.",
            "The AI obviously doesn’t grasp technicalities, which is why a lot of the concepts may not seem entirely feasible but are more of a general visual direction. Some concepts forget to render footrests, some of them play rather loosely with internal components – almost none of the concepts have an exhaust pipe, but there are a few that look like they’ve got a fuel-powered engine. I like that they’ve all skipped the rear view mirrors too, almost like an internal joke about how the Cybertruck didn’t have rear view mirrors during its debut! There are no cracked glass panels on these concepts, thankfully.",
            "This Tesla Cyberbike exploration eventually turned into a headlamp exploration, with the AI going all in on new headlight styles. They’re all undoubtedly sporty, and LED-strip lighting seems to be a recurring theme, but unlike the Cybertruck that just has a single strip running from left to right, these concepts experiment with new shapes and a split-headlight design that gives the motorbike MUCH more character.",
            "The glowing shock absorbers are a nice touch, no?! The image below even goes as far as adding strips to the base and rear for a rather interesting overall aesthetic.",
            "Even with close-ups, the AI did a phenomenal job of rendering out the details of the Cyberbike’s headlight, the glass cover, and even cutouts for air intakes around it, and doing so while keeping things bilaterally symmetrical. Peep in further and you can see what looks like additional lights with reflectors and textured glass, but then again, these images are to be taken strictly at face value.",
            "My final experiments were to also design a dashboard for the motorcycle, and it seems like the AI preferred something more traditional and circular, although a massive touchscreen display seems to be more of a standard in Tesla cars. This dashboard is entirely digital too, although the numbers and letters are gibberish because the AI isn’t capable of generating meaningful text yet (it’s something Nvidia seems to have cracked with their latest AI tool eDiff-I, although that isn’t open for public use yet).",
            "Earlier this year we also covered what an AI-designed Apple Car would look like, created by another AI art bot by the name of DALL·E 2. AI art is definitely making waves this year, and while a lot of talented artists (rightfully so) are afraid this may be the end of human-made art, the tool should also be viewed for what it is, and incredible ideation software that designers and artists can use to create rapid concepts that take mere minutes instead of hours or days."

            "If you had to describe a Lamborghini car in 5 words, I assure you neither of them would be ‘minimal’. The raging-bull Italian luxury car brand is known for building some of the edgiest, most aggressive-looking cars (and even yachts) but they’re all built on the principles of creating automobiles that look like they can dominate. This often means angular surfaces that create aggressive light and shadows, edges that look sharp, and an overall silhouette that looks like a crouching predator. The Lamborghini Ravietta concept, however, is a deviation from this standard. Designed by Cesar Olivera, who wanted to bring the bare-basics style of ‘brutalism’ to Lamborghini’s automotive design, the Ravietta is a slick beast, with form that seems to elevate Lamborghini’s DNA to a new level.",
            "Designer: Cesar Olivera",
            "Most companies are adopting the ‘flat design’ trend with their logos and branding, and it seems like the Lamborghini Ravietta is carrying that forward into the actual design of the car itself. The concept visually celebrates some of Lamborghini’s classic cars like the Diablo and Murcielago (it has the rotary-phone rims from the Countach too), while bringing their simple, sleek surfacing into the future with more dynamic and exaggerated angles, and some of the thinnest headlights ever seen on a car!",
            "The Ravietta sports a pair of razor-sharp Y-shaped headlights that are a hat tip to the Lamborghini Sian and Terzo Millennio, although the headlights blend right into the car’s surface edges, practically camouflaging when switched off and coming to life when the car’s started. Its taillights, interestingly, are built into the slab vents on the car’s rear, marking a deviation from the usual Y-shaped taillights seen on the rear fenders.",
            "For Olivera, the Lamborghini Ravietta was a design exercise in blending some of Lamborghini’s most classic design details with a fresh, clean design aesthetic and some rather fascinating futuristic details like the forward-leaning rear-view cameras, and an overarching windscreen that extends all the way to the top, giving the rider a beautiful glass roof too.",
            "“The Ravietta features a simple bone line, or crease, on the body side that goes from the front corner to the rear corner of the car, thus creating structure on the body,” Olivera mentioned to Carscoops in an interview. “The simple shape of the vehicle is split in half (top to bottom) in a dynamic manner to create a sense of motion, while the red finish on the lower part of the body highlights the stance and the aggressive nature of the design.”",
            "The final result shows that even though minimalism and aggressive detailing, or minimalism and luxury automobiles don’t necessarily go hand in hand, there’s definitely a way to distill Lamborghini’s design DNA into something that’s simple to observe yet equally impactful. A minimalist Lambo… what a solid way to end 2022!"

We should get to see more such interesting concepts coming from GAC Design, and for now, this two-seater EV has set the bar really up high.",
            "The open-wheel design of the two-seater EV has a flattened chassis with no windshield to get the minimal aesthetics going. According to the design team, the car is divided into three parts. The flat chassis being one of them, contains compact batteries, something akin to a smartphone battery. Secondly, there is the streamlined body courtesy of the robust mono-material aluminum frame, keeping everything lightweight and visually timeless.",
            "The third one is the ultra-futuristic interior that comes with a drive-by-wire steering wheel that doubles as the heads-up display for showing vital information like speed and battery levels. To keep the minimalism going, driver and passenger seats are crafted from recycled plastic material. Unlike the usual sports car seats, they gravitate to a shell weighing only 6.6 pounds. When GAC Barchetta is parked or not in use, the steering wheel and panels slide into the cabin. The futuristic headrests and the rear-view mirrors also slide into the body shell, making the EV seem completely flat.",

The AirTag helps you locate your bicycle when it’s missing or if you’re lost in a crowded parking lot, or better still, get notified about its location if it ever gets stolen. The AirBell’s universal design means it can attach to any existing bicycle without really any fancy or expensive upgrades, and uses Apple’s state-of-the-art ultrawide-band chip and ‘Find My’ tracking abilities to keep tabs on the whereabouts of your vehicle.",

            "While e-bikes are all the rage these days, buying a new one can set you back thousands of dollars, or converting your existing bike to an e-bike can require money, time, effort, and needing you to pull your bicycle apart to add the conversion kit. The PikaBoost, on the other hand, is easy enough for a child to install, snaps onto your bicycle without any tools whatsoever, and works on almost all kinds of bicycles, from regular road bicycles to mountain bikes and even those new-fangled folding ones. The way it works is simple – just like how you move the pedals forward to move the bicycle, the PikaBoost uses a motor to push your bicycle forward. The PikaBoost’s motor relays its rotations to a rubber wheel, which sits against your bicycle’s rear wheel, giving it a strangely hybrid ‘rear wheel drive’!",
            "There are a bunch of things that are quite remarkable about the PikaBoost, from the fact that it’s a portable device that snaps on or snaps off bicycles on demand, to its actual abilities that go well beyond just ‘assisting’ your drive. The PikaBoost uses what LIVALL likes to call AAR technology (Automatic Adaptive Rate), or a combination of sensors and algorithms that make your ride smarter by being able to adjust its power based on terrain or based on how tired you are, providing more of a boost wherever necessary. Meanwhile, it recovers that power through an intelligent regenerative system that turns your pedalling into battery power to be used later.",
            "Semi-assisted pedaling.",
            "Fully assisted without pedaling.",
            "Once strapped in place, the PikaBoost offers three broad modes of use based on the degree of assistance it provides. The Cruise mode is perfect for short distances, allowing PikaBoost to handle most of the load during in-city commutes like heading to work, a friend’s place, or on a quick coffee run. Begin riding and the PikaBoost supplies your rear wheel with power to help you maintain your speed, gradually increasing it to give you an all-electric riding experience and reducing the speed based on your braking pattern. An Eco mode provides just the right balance between power-assistance and power-saving. It’s perfect for people who love cycling but don’t have the stamina or physical strength to embark on long journeys over treacherous terrain. In Eco mode, the PikaBoost detects when you’re getting tired or when you’re riding uphill, assisting you to take the pressure off your joints and body. When moving downhill, the PikaBoost switches off the motor and uses your downhill momentum to charge its batteries. The third Exercise mode is nothing like the previous two. While the Cruise and Eco modes assist your riding, the Exercise mode does the opposite, providing a little resistance to make riding more challenging for the more advanced rider. In the Exercise mode, the PikaBoost device basically turns into a dynamo, converting your pedaling power and kinetic energy into electrical energy for it to store in its batteries, boosting your overall range.",
            "E-brake – E-brake allows PikaBoost to cut power to the motor at the moment the brake levers are actuated.",
            "Fall Detection – Once the tilt angle of the bike is detected to be greater than 45 degrees, PikaBoost will immediately stop the motor output.",
            "Slip Detection – PikaBoost switches off the motor and automatically switches to the regenerative system when the bike tire loses traction on road thus causing the bike to skid.",
            "Auto-Sensing Rear Light – Light will automatically light up by detecting the bike’s brake line to keep you safe during your ride.",
            "Wireless Bluetooth Lock – Will automatically lock when the Bluetooth signal on your phone is away from PikaBoost to protect against theft.",
            "Regenerative System – PikaBoost can convert kinetic energy into electricity and hence functions as a power generator.",
            "While the various modes make riding easier or more challenging, the PikaBoost is equipped with a set of features that make riding safer too. The device comes with a built-in accelerometer that can detect falls, automatically stopping the motor if you incline more than 45° to prevent any further injury. If you’re riding on slippery terrain, PikaBoost’s slip detection kicks in, switching off the motor and going into regenerative mode to reduce speed and enhance friction between the wheel and the ground to lower the risk of skidding. Each PikaBoost also comes with a brake sensor that mounts to your bicycle’s handlebars. This E-Brake allows you to directly communicate with the PikaBoost device, getting it to brake everytime you hit the brakes on your bicycle. The E-Brake works remarkably well even when the main brake lines on your bike fail, vastly enhancing your safety and preventing accidents. Moreover, your PikaBoost is built to be IP66 resistant to sand, dust, and water, which means you can ride your bike on any sort of terrain even in the rain, enjoying the experience without any worries.",
            "All these features fit in a device that’s just a little over 13 inches long and weighs 6.6lb (3 kilograms). On the inside, the PikaBoost houses a powerful 250W motor that runs incredibly silently, powered by a 234Wh battery (comprising 18 replaceable battery cells) that gives the PikaBoost output speeds as high as 21mph (30kmh) and ranges of 18 miles (30 kilometers) depending on the mode you’re using. The PikaBoost also comes with a built-in taillight that can be customized to flash or glow solid to keep you visible during the day or night, and a USB-C putput port that lets you charge your devices using the PikaBoost’s battery power. The PikaBoost also comes with a smartphone app that allows you to monitor its stats, set your location so the device adheres to local transport law requirements, and even lock or unlock your PikaBoost from your phone using Bluetooth. Alternatively, you could just detach the PikaBoost device from your bicycle, carrying it around with you to prevent it from being stolen!",
            "Perhaps the cherry on the cake is the fact that the entire PikaBoost kit costs as little as $299 on Kickstarter, where it’s currently accepting pledges from backers. For just that price, you get the PikaBoost device along with the E-Brake sensor, a USB-C cable, a battery compartment, a set of 18650-type battery cells (18 of them), and a quick-start guide. You can add additional accessories to your pledge, like an extra battery pack to boost your range, a mud-guard for your PikaBoost device, or even a universal holder for your smartphone!",

It comes with fog lamps on the front as well as the roof of the car, along with mud guards on the fenders that should keep your automobile spic and span even after a rumble in the dirt. From the looks of it, the car also comes with a higher ground clearance than the Huracan, so it can glide just as well off roads as it can on them… For now, Lamborghini’s only teased images of the Sterrato, although we can expect a few more details at its official debut at Art Basel in Miami on November 30th."

        "segments": [
            "There aren’t many engines that have had quite the illustrious career that the W16 has had. Debuted with the Bugatti Veyron in 2005 (that’s a staggering 17 years ago), the W16 has been at the heart of all Bugattis made since, but the company’s decided to say farewell to it in style – by giving it the ultimate send-off in the form of a stunningly beautiful new racer that brings back Bugatti’s original open-top style. The W16 Mistral, unveiled mere days ago, marks an important epilogue in one of Bugatti’s most noteworthy storylines, with Bugatti CEO Mate Rimac saying, “For the final roadgoing appearance of Bugatti’s legendary W16 engine, we knew we had to create a roadster. Well over 40% of all Bugatti vehicles ever created have been open-top in design, establishing a long lineage of performance icons that – to this day – are revered the world over. In the Chiron era there had, to-date, been no roadster, so the introduction of Bugatti W16 Mistral continues this legacy, driven by enormous demand from our clients for an all-new way to experience the mighty performance of our iconic engine. The W16 Mistral opens the next chapter in the Bugatti roadster story, inspired by over a century of open-top legends.”",
            "Designer: Bugatti",
            "The engine, however, is just a mere component in the glorious machine that’s the W16 Mistral. Named after the powerful wind that blows from the Rhône River valley, through the Côte d’Azur in southern France and into the Mediterranean, the car touts power, along with a performance that can ‘blow you away’. The car comes with a stellar open-top design that harks back to Bugatti’s origins with some of the first cars being open-top racers. Shift your eyes to the side and you’ve got one of the most interesting profiles possible. There’s a gestalt of continuity with the open-top design, and the car isn’t one to shy away from tight curves in certain places, and fuller arcs in others. The car still comes with Bugatti’s horseshoe radiator (although one could wonder what would happen of this detail if the company’s next powertrain was electric), aggressively sculpted air-vents on the front, side, and back, and that gorgeous C-pillar on the back that still comes with a tight C-shaped design. The headlights on the front sport four bars that “subtly nods to the W16 Mistral’s four-wheel-drive and four turbochargers”, mentions Frank Heyl, Bugatti’s Deputy Design Director.",
            "“We know the W16 Mistral will always have significance in the story of Bugatti, marking the last time that perhaps the greatest ever automotive powertrain is used in a roadgoing production car”, said Achim Anscheidt, Design Director at Bugatti. “We, as a design team, felt enormous pressure to deliver styling that immediately conveyed this landmark moment, drawing inspiration from some of the most beautiful roadsters in Bugatti history.”",
            "The X-shaped taillights show the company’s willingness to still retain a canvas for exploration. While the front of every Bugatti since the Veyron has remained strongly loyal to the brand DNA, the rear of the car still has its creative elements that allow each model to stand apart, from the Veyron to the Chiron, Divo, Centodieci, Bolide, and the La Voiture Noire. The X seems like a hat-tip to the Bolide’s X-shaped headlights and taillights, although much more striking and elegant, and believe it or not, functional. Heyl mentions that the X-taillight “serves the function of venting the side oil coolers through ducts connecting the triangular negative space in between the X beams to the side radiators. Therefore, a pressure drop is created between the side intakes and the outlets at the back of the W16 Mistral which helps to manage the mid-temperature cooling circuit of the mighty W16 most effectively.”",
            "The color scheme is no coincidence either. The black/yellow palette is an ultimate hat-tip to the company’s founder, Ettore Bugatti, who chose the black and yellow combination for many of his personal cars, including his Type 41 Royale. This celebration of color continues onto the inside of the cars too, creating a kind of contrast that seems striking yet pleasant.",
            "Bugatti plans on building only 99 units of the W16 Mistral, with deliveries in 2024. Priced at a whopping 5 million euros, the car’s entire production run has already been sold out!"

            "While slim speakers aren’t entirely new, this application for them definitely is. Any panel or surface capable of vibrating has the ability to be a speaker, and television and smartphone makers have tried turning displays into speakers by getting them to vibrate ever so gently, enough to create audio that can transmit from the display all the way to the wearer. LG’s Thin Actuator Sound Solution brings that technology to the insides of cars, potentially allowing display panels and other surfaces to vibrate and generate audio that fills the car’s interiors. Traditionally, speakers have occupied a fair bit of space given the voice coils, cones and magnets used in their construction – this meant building speakers into doors given their hollow design. Thanks to the Thin Actuator Sound Solution, carmakers can turn virtually any surface into a speaker, allowing for a more immersive soundscape where audio plays from the sides, back, front, and perhaps even the top of the car.",

Working in partnership with a global audio company, LG ensured that these panels provide rich audio that doesn’t deviate from the quality that passengers have come to expect. Moreover, the speakers don’t rely on rare-earth elements like Neodymium magnets to produce audio, boosting their overall eco-friendly factor.",

Designed by Alexander Yamaev, this oddly eye-catching tricycle scooter concept comes with a rectangular side profile that slices through the air the way a credit card swipes through a payment machine, and a unique wheel setup featuring a massive front wheel that surrounds the scooter’s transparent bubble-shaped cockpit, and two rear wheels that separate at low speeds for stability, and unite at high speeds for maneuverability. The ideas that Yamaev’s concept present are certainly radical, with a design so groundbreakingly unique it’ll make the Cybertruck look outdated.",
            "Designer: Alexander Yamaev",
            "Broadly, the concept can be broken down into its three most unique aspects – the shape, the wheels, and the cockpit. As far as the concept’s shape goes, there’s nothing quite like it. It’s eye-catching in a way that seems hyper-modern, but I’ll be absolutely candid – I don’t DISLIKE it. It looks fun, futuristic, and like something that I could see in an urban metropolis. Does it lack character because of its boxy design? If the streets were filled with hundreds of these, I’d argue they’d look less appealing or individualistic… but then again, these scooters feel like a public utility more than a personal vehicle. I’d imagine this being the new rental bike that people can pick up and drop off anywhere. That’s just how I feel.",
            "The wheels present an interesting deviation from the ordinary. While most scooters come with two equal-sized wheels, Yamaev’s concept has no such limitation. The scooter’s wheel layout features a unique arrangement of three wheels – a larger one in the front, and two smaller ones at the back… almost like a tricycle version of a ‘penny farthing’. The larger wheel measures an estimated 6 feet in diameter, fitting an entire closed cockpit inside it, while the two smaller wheels at the back separate at slow speeds or when the scooter’s parked (so you don’t need a stand) and come closer together as the scooter picks up speed to offer aerodynamism and easy maneuverability.",
            "The concept’s cockpit remains a feature that I simultaneously love and hate. The enclosed bubble design feels inspired, and solves a major problem with two-wheelers – bad weather. Sitting in the comfort of a chair in a closed cockpit just makes the idea of riding in the rain or a blizzard more comfortable. An enclosed space means the scooter can have its own air conditioning too, for hot days. However, there are two rather major caveats here. Firstly, a tight, enclosed space is bound to give a significant chunk of people claustrophobia. There aren’t any windows on the scooter, which exacerbate the problem. The second problem, and arguably the more pressing one, is the fact that the scooter’s design essentially obscures the front view of the rider. Sure, the bubble cockpit really offers a panoramic view on the sides, but the scooter’s design (and that wheel) obstruct the front view of the rider, making it very difficult to drive forward with certainty. Sure, Yamaev obviously thought of this while designing his concept, he included a large portrait display right in front of the driver that gives them a front-facing view of everything ahead of the scooter. I can think of a lot of scenarios in which this would be less than ideal. Seeing digital elements on screen isn’t really as good as actually seeing them in real life. Screens have latency, will sometimes distort colors, and most importantly, are prone to failure. However, they aren’t entirely inconceivable. They work better in the dark, offering clearer views than your eyes can see."

            "I live in a place where road traffic congestion has gotten so bad that you have to leave hours early to get to an appointment that is just in the next town or city. I sometimes suspect the government has given up on finding solutions to mobility and so we will eventually have to depend on private companies that will come up with experimental solutions to getting people and goods around the city more easily.",
            "Designer: Half Company",
            "The Bulgaria-based designers for the transport design studio is proposing a city-wide transport system called Halfgrid. It involves individual person-sized capsules moving around the city through suspended cables and powered by artificial intelligence. Basically, you can get a person and whatever goods you want to be transported to your destination on a separate layer above ground in order to not add to the continuous road congestion on the ground.",
            "The system uses static cables and the pods are the ones that will be moving along the tensioned steel ropeways. This also means that each of the capsule units can travel to different destinations unlike with the traditional cable car system where everyone still has to get into a vehicle together. Each pod will be able to hold just one person or a certain-sized package and can be programmed to get to where they need to get to.",
            "Passengers will be able to program everything through the app and choose a pickup point and a destination. Basically, it’s like booking an Uber except you’ll be traveling in a capsule above ground. The same system can be used for goods deliveries. The entire system is also designed to be “practically silent” so it will not add to the noise pollution that usually comes with road congestion.",
            "I’m not that fond of heights so this is something that might not work for someone like me. But it would really be interesting to see how such a system can work in a city like where I live in. Now the next step is to create a prototype and find a partner and a pilot city that would be willing to try the Halfgrid out."

Just as the name suggests, the whole package is an expansive-looking house that goes where the Jeep goes. What makes it different from the other trailer homes is that can be hooked onto a 4×4 MUV – well, it doesn’t ride on wheels and is completely assembled on-site.",
            "Designer: Jeep Japan",
            "Jeep Container Home is basically a house ready to pack up and set up at the desired location with little effort. Surely, this one is not as easy to move as a tiny house on wheels or tent – still there are good merits. Compared to container homes, the Jeep’s concept home has sides that open up to the views and a skylight that brings a sense of airiness. Sliding the wooden barn doors opens up the interiors to the outside view and the windows come to view when the iron shutters are opened. For extended stays at one location, there’s the option to install glazing and solid shutters too.",
            "The whole layout of the modular home setup is customizable with options to have a rooftop deck, go for open air-living, or add extensions for more usable space. For now, the concept proposes a bare inside area sans any amenities or furniture for more flexibility in setting up things as the user desires. Other than that, the Jeep Container House is equipped with rooftop solar panels for completely off-grid living in remote regions. When parked, the electric vehicle (Jeep is developing hybrid and all-electric versions currently) is charged via the sustainable system.",
            "For now, the concept design is in the Jeep study phase and more details will float in once, the maker gets more serious about this idea. For us, right now this concept has the right direction but lacks a bit in long-term practical execution. That’s because the Jeep connection and semi-open design don’t seem to add up (or maybe I’m interpreting things wrongly). The idea could easily be implemented for a container house conversion too without all the complexities."

The model also boasts a fully customizable touch-screen that displays the speed, pollution index, battery levels, and an integrated GPS system.",
            "“With road transport accounting for over 10 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, a figure that continues to rise faster than any other sector, Angell bikes have been created to innovatively transform city dwellers’ commutes while reducing environmental impact,” said Angell.",
            "S/Rapide is the successor of Angell’s original M/Rapide bike and aims to be even sleeker and lighter. The bicycle features a lightweight goose-neck frame, accompanied by a classic leather seat, as well as an inclined crossbar. The crossbar is smaller compared to the crossbar seen on the M/Rapide. These dainty features make S/Rapide “one of the world’s lightest e-bikes”. S/Rapide has been equipped with a removable battery that charges completely within 2 hours and can support about 50 kilometers of cycling. The vibrating handlebars guide you while riding the bike. They vibrate and indicate which direction to go while navigating. Pretty cool, right?",
            "“Angell expertly fills a gap in the market for a functional yet beautiful product that does not compromise the ability to move quickly and freely around cities, whilst simultaneously enhancing the eco-responsibility and safety of our urban environment,” said the brand."

So, you’ll be getting able assistance on inclines when required, and no assistance when going downhill.",
            "Safety is paramount here, so the bike comes with regulatory reflector badges and reflective bands on the sides, making it visible during dark hours or commuting in inclement weather conditions. The weight is another factor that’s important for the trailer to be viable in practical situations, hence, the monocoque capsule design. There’s a kickstand too for easy parking and the wheel is also of a standard bicycle size for adaptability with most models out there. The rechargeable digital motor and the battery pack reside at the bottom of the trailer for visual aesthetics.",

Would an eco-conscious city commuter want this for times when there is a desperate need? Absolutely yes, given the option to attach it on demand rather than having it there all the time"

In opposition to the large and bulky e-scooters that litter the market, the Skate-X is espousing minimalism to create not only a pleasing visual aesthetic but also a lean form that helps keep the vehicle light. For example, it uses a simple yet effective three-pole frame to securely hold the skateboard deck instead of the typical hefty platforms you’d find on other electric scooters.",

The car makes some rather unique choices with its form. It sports massive cutouts on the front that feel inspired by the BMW kidney grille, but rather give sight to the front wheel suspension. The same goes for the rear, with a centralized suspension system.",
            "Given the experimental nature of the car’s design (and that it’s more of a form study than an actual concept), one can make a few assumptions, like the fact that the Traroca V1 is probably a 4-wheel e-drive considering the absence of a large engine or exhaust. The bodywork on the car is relatively seamless too, and its Class A surfaces are noteworthy, given that everything flows into one another. There isn’t a single sharp edge or corner on the body, and it seems like the Traroca V1 was sculpted by air with a little touch of generative design. However, it’s virtually impossible to tell that the car was made entirely in Blender by a 17-year-old! You can follow Rupesh’s automotive design escapades on his Instagram."

Despite being so close to production, the details of the gull-winged Model JZD are scanty, as not much has been let out in the official press release.

According to them, the new company is “not supported or endorsed in any way by John DeLorean and we do not wish to be associated with their actions against his Legacy.” Speaking of which, Kat has an engineering background and has been closely associated with her father’s iconic designs. Therefore, the Model JZD is also deep-rooted in the values of “quality, safety, longevity, and affordability” of John who passed away in 2005.",

Originally unveiled at the 19th China International Motorcycle Exhibition in Chongqing last year, the XCELL pioneers hydrogen fuel-cell technology, relying on four cylindrical cells that sit in the front of the motorbike’s fairing. Except for the fact that it has two wheels, a seat, and is controlled by a user who operates it using handlebars, the XCELL is quite unlike any other two-wheeler before it. It features an adjustable design that allows the handlebars to pivot forward or backward, laser headlights that work remarkably well in the dark, and a drone that automatically lifts off the motorcycle to help evaluate the condition of the roads ahead, presenting holographic obstacles for the rider to clearly see as they drive down roads.",

            "Another large component of the XCELL is driver safety and comfort. The motorbike’s unique design seats one and comes with an adjustable riding triangle (seat, bar, footpeg). The handlebars move forward and backward, allowing you to change your riding stance, opting for either a traditional stance or leaning forward for a more racing-like aerodynamic seating position.",

The motorcycle comes with its own drone that sits right above the taillight (shown below), which takes off and flies ahead of the rider, capturing the road ahead as well as obstacles around corners. This data is fed to the XCELL’s holographic display that allows the rider to make informed decisions by knowing what they otherwise wouldn’t know. Pair this with powerful laser headlights and night vision assistance and you’ve got yourself a motorcycle that makes riding dramatically safer by providing crucial information to help riders make more informed decisions while on the road.",

If you are a solo traveler, you need a compact solution that can put you behind the pedal and take you a few miles to the middle of nowhere and get you back home after a satisfactory weekend with yourself.",
            "For the love of everyone still reading this, the GoLo electric cargo bike has been retrofitted by Flevobike Technology with a fold-out camping module. It renders a single-seat mobility solution with a place to hop into at the end of the journey for a relaxed time. Dubbed “the best camper in the world,” the GoCamp is a bike camper with a removable top for overnight halts that offers (quite literally) the comfort of home for one person.",
            "Designer: Flevobike Technology and GoLo electric bike",
            "The cargo bike GoLo is essentially a viable ride, combining comfort with functionality and convenience, therefore a convenient canvas set up on the cargo bed offers independence to the traveling cyclist when they want to relax and unwind. The pop-up module extends to make enough space for a couple to sit. It is slightly cramped for two to sleep in there. On the inside, you get enough storage space for gear and accessories, a fold-down table (usable as a workstation and for dining), and seating for two, which can be laid flat to convert the living space into a bedroom for the night.",
            "The nicely ventilated GoCamp comes with a 60W fridge inside and a drawer in the lower section of the bike for a spare wheel and other spares. Designed to never let you worry about working from anywhere, the GoCamp is pre-installed with a 400-W solar panel system on the roof and side panels of the fold-out module and offers USB, 12V, and a 220V outlet on the inside. The bike camper runs on a 250W electric motor promising 50 km mileage. The pictures of the GoCamp you see here are the initial prototypes; as of now, there is no word on when the bike camper will go into production and how much of a hole it will burn in our pockets. Until we hear something on this, you ride tight on your bikes!"

They inevitably always end up in landfills, and while almost every part of a car can be stripped for parts, repurposed, refurbished, or recycled, a steering wheel usually isn’t. The ‘Cercle’ changes that. With a design that is both advanced as well as recyclable, the Cercle adopts a circular economy approach to design. It comes with touch-sensitive inputs that bring a cutting-edge experience to your ride… but more importantly, the Cercle can be pulled apart, repaired, and recycled. Internal tech can be swapped out, external housing can be replaced (if broken), all without compromising on the Cercle’s user experience.",
            "Designer: PDR Design",
            "The Cercle upgrades the steering wheel by opting for a sleeker design that gives you haptic touch-based controls right under your fingertips. You’ve got a wheel with a backlit logo in the center, horns on each side, and arrow keys that trigger the indicators.",
            "“More than 20 million vehicles reach the end of life each year in the EU and the US”, say the designers. “With their complex, multi-material construction and integrated controls, Steering wheels defy recycling.”",
            "Designers at PDR decided that in order to make the wheel more advanced, it had to be more repairable. The Cercle, to that end, has a design that’s easy to disassemble, repair, and refurbish. It’s hard to imagine a single steering wheel being a standard (just the way seatbelts are an unwavering standard), but Cercle was designed for a speculative world where car brands could just opt for a standard steering wheel design that also happened to be repairable, helping reduce landfill waste.",

            "The Alte Volare is what they call a tender, or a boat that carries passengers (and sometimes cargo) to yachts or ships positioned off the coast. Designed by the superyacht specialists at Cockswell, the Alte Volare is the result of a years-long technical study that pushes the boundaries of what’s possible “when it comes to fusing advanced engineering with intelligent design.” The elongated ‘limousine tender’ features a combination of an electric powertrain, retractable hydrofoils, and a sleek fuselage-like hull, and was unveiled as a technical study this month at the Monaco Yacht Show.",
            "Designer: Cockwells",
            "The Alte Volare’s USP is its ability to hover over water, instead of on it. Its design features an incredibly aerodynamic hull with a razor-sharp bow that slices through both water and air. The e-tender features two retractable foils, one on the front with an electric powertrain built into it that propels the boat, and a rear foil that incorporates the control surfaces for steering, braking, etc.",
            "If you’ve ever tried running underwater, you’d know that it’s much more difficult than running on land (or basically through air). Water offers more resistance, leading to higher drag that slows boats down, even though boats are just partially underwater. With a hydrofoil, however, the boat’s hull sits above water instead, and that drag is therefore greatly reduced. It also means that waves don’t slow the hydrofoil down, and the Alte Volare uses that to its advantage, slicing through water and air like a sniper’s bullet at speeds of up to 40 knots (74 km/h).",
            "The boat seats as many as 10, along with a 2-person crew, and features seating areas at the front (or the bow), right behind the cockpit, and even at the stern (or the rear). No matter where you’re seated, occupants are treated with a stunning view of what’s around them, thanks to a predominantly open structure. The seating area behind the cockpit is covered with large glass panels that provide a panoramic view too (which people can retreat to if it starts raining)."

The reference to the city of Milan came from the fact that it’s considered the mecca of modern car design, and was also the hometown of Baldini’s petrolhead grandfather, who inspired him to take up car design as a profession.",
            "Designer: Alex Imnadze Baldini",
            "The car, drenched in red, looks like something right out of Ferrari’s Maranello factory, but it’s about as independent as they come. Sure, one could say there are a few similarities between the Milano Vision GT and Ferrari 296 GTB, although Baldini’s own rendition looks arguably sexier and more streamlined. The car’s top view is remarkedly different too, and gives a glimpse of a powerful V8 engine that runs the show.",
            "The car’s front looks almost like it’s been stretched by the sheer force of inertia against it. The headlights and even the grill stretch backwards, giving the effect of how one’s face gets pulled backward when traveling at high speeds. It’s a clever trick to highlight the Milano Vision GT’s abilities, along with cutouts in just the right places to guide the air both outside and within the car, cooling its components.",
            "The automobile takes its silhouette and form very seriously, with incredibly controlled curves that create a car that looks voluptuous yet aerodynamic (those quarter panels almost look like muscles). There aren’t too many straight lines – in fact, one could argue that there are none, barring the split lines on the car’s surfaces near the door and the rear.",
            "It’s a shame this car doesn’t exist yet. No, not even in a video game… although if there’s a gaming exec out there looking to add more variety to their racing titles, Alex is rather active on Instagram.",

Thus, the vehicle is primarily used for adventures and dirt-laden tracks for the outdoorsy who love to head outside the city limits every now and then. Don’t expect it to go at breakneck speeds on the freeway (it’s more like a crawling machine) since the entry-level variant maxes out at 29 mph and the much more powerful version churns out a 50 mph top speed.",

One big advantage here is the ability to charge via a standard outlet in just a few hours. Rather than being a full-blown SUV or MUV, La Bagnole is more of an alternative to a two-wheeler with the freedom to tread inhospitable terrain. More so when it has got a steel chassis and galvanized steel double-wishbone suspension. Those skinny tires don’t look to assuring for a hardcore off-roading experience, still good enough for the odd detour down the trails. For times when you need to haul medium-sized cargo, the vehicle won’t let you down.",

There is even an option to charge the battery off-grid with integrated solar panels. The vehicle debuted at the Paris Motor Show last week and grabbed attention for its unconventional looks.",

The modern compact city car was a good alternative to Fiat 128 and was popular among the crowd for its cheesy design and thumping attitude back in 1977.",

Although not any inspiration derived from some old model for looks, the Yugo Ampera concept is meant for the pure thrill of driving without being harmful to the environment. Marko admits that he wanted the EV supercar to look like a Lotus and adopt the technology of a Rimac Automobili based in Croatia. The result is a handsome-looking performance beast with 4 engine motors, an independent suspension system, and an advanced charging system.",

The propeller generates power and AEC connected to the wheel engines delivers power directly. The complex system has a configuration system and propeller cage in the lower position mated to the tunnel and turbine generator. The air intakes we see here are not for the looks and are fully functional to enhance the power delivery of the Ampera.",

According to Ken, the new installation of the Gymkhana series is the progressive evolution of the brand. While he loves the roar of a V-8 powertrain and turbo engine, the all-electric platform has enough performance under the belly to eat up three times more tires (around 100 tires) than during normal filming. That’s because of the Group B-inspired EV’s Formula E motors powering each axle. The result is an all-wheel-drive bi-motor setup generating a mind-numbing 4400 pound-feet of torque.",

They should become very useful when fixed charging stations can be arranged.” Over 120 years later, Rolls-Royce fulfilled Rolls’ prophecy of an electrified motor car. Spectre swapped out a gas engine for a clean and noiseless electric motors, capable of 577 hp, 664 lb-ft of torque, 0-60 in 4.4 seconds, and good for an estimated 260 EPA range.",

I am not a big fan, but the way Spectre’s split headlight integrates into Rolls-Royce’s most expansive grille looks might be fine. The vanes of the Pantheon grille are now smoother in section and flush fit, allowing for better aerodynamics around the front. The vane’s backside is sandblasted, allowing the grille to illuminate using 22 LED lights softly.",

            "You’d be right if you think that the Spectre has a striking resemblance to the Phantom Coupé. Pairing Spectre with 23-inch wheels is the first for RR because of the proportion demanded it. Spectre has a curb weight of 6559 lbs and a wheelbase of 126.377 inches. It’s heavy, but thanks to the integration and placement of the battery into the highly flexible all-aluminum spaceframe make it 30% stiffer than any previous Rolls-Royce. The most significant benefit of this architecture is the flexibility for the placement of the floor halfway between the sill structure instead of on top or underneath them, allowing for a perfectly smooth underfloor profile. Thanks to the placement of the 700 kg battery, it also helps keep out unwanted road noise.",
            "New for Spectre is the availability of Starlight Doors, which incorporate 4,796 softly illuminated ‘stars”. Spectre still has months of testing and optimization ahead, but RR is available for commission immediately, and customers can expect delivery in the fourth quarter of 2023. Buyers should expect pricing to fall between Cullinan and Phantom, meaning you’re looking to pay anywhere between $335,350 to $460,000 before adding ticking the checkbox for Starlight Headliner.",
            "As with any RR, customers can commission the Spectre with any material choice – any by any. I mean that there are “nearly-infinite” Bespoke possibilities.",

You can try designing your course from the app first, which lets you see how many pieces you have left, or you can just add the track after you’re done by having your MODI Racer run through the course while scanning it. While the track helps keep the cars on track, you can always drive them off a corner, accidentally or otherwise. There’s no reason to worry, though, since you can simply drive them back onto the course to get back into the game.",
            "The MODIplay RACING app is the bridge that brings all these elements together, and it’s definitely more than just a remote for the car.

The challenge’s 23rd annual theme pushes participants to look at sustainable mobility through three different lenses: People, Profit, and Planet.",
            "This year’s theme focuses not on the societal/human divide, but rather on existing mobility solutions’ lack of sustainable growth and practices. The challenge’s brief invites participants to “design a disruptive mobility solution that balances the three recognized pillars of Sustainability: PEOPLE, PROFIT and PLANET”. Sustainability, a key driver in the acceleration of mobility transformation, is balanced on the pillars of people, profit, and planet, but many initiatives focus on just one or two pillars without taking a holistic approach. Applications must present a genuine model of safe and efficient mobility that meets users’ expectations and is part of a viable economic model for moving people and respecting the environment. With this new approach, the challenge’s appeal extends well beyond traditional transportation design. It’s now open to artists, designers, engineers, architects, city planners, creatives, or anyone with a strong vision to build a more equitable, sustainable future by considering mankind’s need for and relation to mobility. Participants are encouraged to:",

Entries will be judged by a prestigious international jury panel, including heads of advanced design for major mobility organizations, and the winners of the 23rd Movin’On Challenge Design will be revealed at the Movin’On Summit in June 2023. The upcoming challenge will see three winners securing the top spots, and as an addition to its existing format, the top 3 winners will receive an opportunity to meet with the Movin’On Challenge Design team and juror representatives to review their entries, portfolio, and career plans.",

The car bridges financial and social inequality while also solving the city’s congestion problem. Moreover, designed as a cultural hat-tip to Brazil’s history, the car’s design is inspired by a hammock, which was used by Brazilians as early as the 16th century to elevate and protect them from animals in the forest.",

RR Alpha is a vision to bridge between rural and urban to fulfil the rural requirements. Designed as a large vehicle with a built-in gyroscope and a zorb-inspired driver cabin, the RR Alpha provides the perfect level of stability required to commute between urban and rural setups while comfortably dealing with uneven roads, mud, terrain, and mountainous precipices. “This solution can deliver a large number of goods of different terrain simultaneously”, says designer Sheik Imthiyas Ahamed. “Many Indian rural face flood situations in periodic time RR.

        "segments": [
            "It’s only natural for humans to dream of a better and brighter future, no matter what current realities would seem to imply. That’s why concept designs naturally portray ideal scenarios in design languages that appeal to current design trends, as if those would remain the same in the future. For future vehicles, that often translates to designs with smooth and pleasing curves, clean and clear surfaces, and often light or bright hues. Design trends and styles come and go, of course, and what may be en vogue today might not be fashionable in a decade or so. Clean, minimalist vehicles might not be the future we’ll be facing, and this limited edition motorcycle offers an alternative version, one that may seem rough and perhaps a little bit dystopian.",
            "Designer: Voyager",
            "While vehicles are logically designed with movement in mind, but there are also other factors that need to be taken into account for a machine that can be used by humans. Safety is at the very top of that list, of course, but a vehicle must also be comfortable. The design of today’s cars and motorbikes has undergone decades of refinement and improvement exactly for those reasons, but this commissioned SOLID EV motorcycle seems to throw comfort out the window, at least visually speaking.",
            "The SOLID CRS-01 looks rough, sharp, and almost menacing, properties that are often attributed to the brutalist design style. It’s almost as if sheets of metal were simply folded at sharp angles and assembled together with wheels, engines, and other parts that make a motorcycle move. And, in a way, that’s exactly how this motorcycle was designed. It was conceptualized with a modular approach using cost-effective materials, and the fairing is exactly made from sheet metal.",
            "This gives the motorbike a distinct look where it seems like the world had run out of materials to use or factories to cast metal into a more pleasing shape. Not that the CRS-01 is unattractive, but it does have a more dominating presence compared to motorcycles, both present and future. It definitely doesn’t look comfortable to ride on since its body doesn’t seem designed to take into account the softer and curvier form of the human body. It certainly has character, one that makes it clear it means serious business.",
            "At the same time, it doesn’t look like it will easily come apart or get dinged at the slightest accident, like what some futuristic concept designs portray. It seems more like it was designed for rough terrains and environments, which some would automatically associate with dystopian settings or even the cyberpunk genre. Who knows? That might be what’s waiting for us, though we’d hopefully wise up before that bleak future becomes our present."

VAYA’s flexibility and modularity make it a great option if you’re constantly moving to different locations, and have a large family.",

The sleek home on wheels has been equipped with additional solar panels on the roof, as well as smart regulation technology for the energy cycle. The regulation technology is an additional feature, and both these amenities make VAYA an energy-independent vehicle.",
            "A fully functional outdoor kitchen has been integrated into the sheathing of the mobile porch, which starts up electromechanically. The outdoor kitchen ensures no unpleasant odors circulate within the interior of the home and is also pretty convenient. It frees up the home and ensures there is additional space that can be utilized for other purposes. It’s also always fun to grill up something in outdoors!",
            "Although convenience and functionality are two factors that are always focused upon in a mobile home, the designer went one step further and designed VAYA with immense attention to detail, and consciousness. The subtle LED lighting is switched on remotely using motion sensors. The living room has been equipped with a soft corner sofa which transforms into a cozy guest bedroom.",
            "You can choose between different types of materials, color shades, and decorative upholstery – according to your personal preference and taste. VAYA guarantees that only premium quality materials have been utilized while doing up the interiors. Besides VAYA’s functionality and practicality, its aesthetics and impressive exterior and interior win it a bunch of brownie points! Since most practically-designed mobile homes these days tend to focus primarily on convenience rather than details and finesse."

            "Named after a large wild Eurasian ox that was the ancestor of domestic cattle, the Lamborghini Aurochs is the kind of ‘road animal’ that doesn’t necessarily need a road under it. Designed to be like a spiritual relative of the Urus, the Aurochs is the kind of vehicle that dominates no matter what terrain it is on. Unlike the Urus, its visual language is amped up too, looking like the wild ancestor to the relatively tame current Lambo SUV. The Aurochs looks muscular, sinewy, and like it shouldn’t be messed with – just like an ox!",
            "Designer: Dejan Hristov",
            "The Aurochs’ design looks unapologetically like a Lamborghini, but designer Dejan Hristov was certain to not use the Urus as too much of a reference. Instead, the Aurochs looks like a bulkier Sián and Terzo Millennio sibling. It has relatively hidden headlights that sit immediately under the hood, but also sports the iconic Y-shaped design detail on the front that’s characteristic of a modern Lamborghini.",
            "The rear is a bit of a deviation in terms of how the taillight’s designed. The taillight assumes the shape of a jagged outline that feels like a part of Lamborghini’s visual DNA, but isn’t particularly employed in any of their existing cars. The exhaust area looks rather different too, with a plus-shaped detail that almost makes me think of MINI, but catch myself when I do. A rather sculptural spoiler sits on the top, looking less like a functional element and more like an artistic detail.",
            "What sets the Aurochs apart is its deviation from Lamborghini’s angular approach to car body design. If you examine any of their most popular cars like the Aventador, Huracan, Gallardo, even the new Countach… it’s fairly evident that the Italian company wholly embraces sharp edges and straight lines – something the Aurochs doesn’t. Sure, the Aurochs DOES have its fair share of edgy details and angular surfaces, but almost all of them are connected to each other by generously curved transitions that make the Aurochs feel less ‘robotic’ and more naturally aggressive. The name Aurochs, in this scenario, really rings true just because of the conceptual SUV’s size and its bold, brutish, muscular nature that feels a lot like looking at an ox in the wild. Unlike the 4-seater Urus, the Aurochs doesn’t care about being accommodating either. It seats two people comfortably, and is designed purely for the thrill of having a Lambo engine go ape-shit on rough natural terrain…"

For a more convincing connection between the two, there is the rocker cover in Grigio Liqueo with a Nero Aldebaran pinstripe that stretches out from the front to the rear diffuser. To emulate the Miura’s look, the Aventador LP 780-4 Ultimae Roadster has the striking Aldebaran livery on the bonnet. There’s also the semblance of a black-painted scoop of the Miura, the matte back tailpipes and the shiny silver with black calipers.",

The retro-inspiration carries down to the steering wheel, vintage-themed analog instrument cluster and the classic stickshift shift knob.",

            "The Renault R5 Turbo 3E is a two-seater tribute to the Renault 5 Turbo and Turbo 2. This little charmer is purely made for drifting on the tarmac, making it more than just eye candy. No wonder Ken Block would be keen to test this car’s drifting skills with his extreme maneuvers.",
            "Designer: Renault",
            "The hot hatch is propelled by an all-electric drivetrain, but that doesn’t make it incapable when stacked against the fuel-powered versions. There’s an independent motor on each of its rear wheels churning out 375 bhp and 516 lb-ft torque. According to the French automaker’s claims, the R5 Turbo 3E can go from 0-62mph in 3.5 seconds and achieve a top speed of 124mph. There is no mention of the estimated range from the 42kWh battery, but it should be on the lower side, assuming this is a performance four-wheeler and is much heavier than its gasoline-powered inspirations.",
            "There’s an FIA-approved roll cage and the body is carved out of carbon fiber. For optimum airflow and downforce, there are front-bumper inlets and that huge rear wing. The flashing pink, blue and yellow brings that nostalgic 90s video game vibe to this machine. The electric drifter rides on 19-inch front and 20-inch rear wheels.",
            "That fact is reinforced by Renault vice president of design, Gilles Vidal’s statement that “Renault 5 TURBO 3E combines ultra-tech design and wilful exuberance with numerous references to the world of car racing and video games.” He also believes the electric drifter reclaims its space in the drifting world and electric cars can indeed be “fun with incredible performance!”",
            "The electric drifter rides on 19-inch front and 20-inch rear wheels. It has ten mounting brackets, which can be installed inside and on the outside to capture all the action while showing off your skills. Truly, this baby is tailor-made for a Cyberpunk world, and we can’t wait to see it next month at the 2022 Paris Motor Show."

            "Personal mobility devices have become more popular and sought-after over the past few years. Whether it’s to escape traffic congestion or as a means to reduce the reliance on fuel-chugging cars, vehicles like electric scooters and electric bikes have become en vogue among certain classes of people and commuters. But just like foot-powered bicycles, the applications of such personal transporters are limited to the terrain, their motors, and most especially, their batteries. Given how these devices balance you on two wheels while standing, it’s probably for the best that they aren’t able to go all out in speed and range. Of course, that doesn’t mean it’s not possible to push the envelope, and that’s exactly the kind of upgraded experience that D-Fly’s hyperscooters are offering both in terms of performance and aesthetics.",

Like a cross between a scooter and a car, these four wheels, each with 10-inch pneumatic tires, offer better stability and reliability, especially when running on difficult terrain. D-Fly’s patented three-dimensional Full-Tilt Steering System makes controlling those four wheels easy and intuitive. In addition to the typical turning of the handlebar, this novel technology syncs the hyperscooter with the rider’s movements, allowing simple tilts to control the ride with more precision.",
            "With two more wheels than normal, you’d expect the Dragonfly to offer more power, and it definitely doesn’t disappoint. Powered by two 550W motors, these powerful e-scooters boast top speeds of 25 mph (40 km/h) and a range of 49.7 miles (80 km) on a full charge.",
            "Despite that speed, the hyperscooters are still designed with safety and comfort in mind, thanks to a dual wishbone suspension and adjustable hydraulic damped spring suspensions for each wheel. Whether you’re zipping through highway traffic or riding through a challenging adventure, the Dragonfly Hydroscooter will get you from A to B quickly and safely.",

The Dragonfly X or DFX, on the other hand, is made for speedsters and adventurers with its wider fender and hand guards. Whichever model you choose, you will get an eye-catching electronic scooter whose handsome looks testify to its power.",

            "The Trailer Drone works on a fully autonomous framework, requiring absolutely no human intervention in the operational process. The large E-Bogies house the fuel cells as well as provide a large space for cargo, and are operated by the platform-shaped drones that plug into the front and rear, giving it increased and autonomous mobility. “The e-Bogie, derived from railroad car technology, is a driverless mobility concept that efficiently houses essential components such as propulsion, control, steering, and suspension units within a limited space”, say the Hyundai Design team led by team lead Lee SangYup.",
            "Designer: Hyundai Design Center",
            "The Trailer Drone is an exhaustive and modular ecosystem featuring E-Bogies and smart drone platforms that can operate them within warehouses as well as on roads with Level 5 autonomy. The lack of humans makes the entire operation safer and smarter, and the absence of a traditional ‘cockpit’ means more space to store cargo and additional room for fuel cells, boosting efficiency.",
            "The E-Bogies house multiple hydrogen fuel cells, which provide power to the drone platforms while being 100% emission-free and safe for the environment. The hydrogen tanks, which are mounted at the front and bottom of the E-Bogies, provide a range of 1,600km per charge. The concept secured the Luminary Winner title at this year’s Red Dot Design Concept Award for its unique take on modularity and mobility. The team at Hyundai managed to build a self-sustaining emission-free framework that allows for the efficient transportation of cargo with little human intervention. The drones can transport cargo within storage yards as well as across cities/states, relying on smart level 5 autonomous technologies that allow them to efficiently get from A to B. In the event that multiple trailers need transporting, they link up wirelessly, forming an invisible train of sorts that can efficiently travel on roads and highways without having a human at the wheel.",

            "Their latest concept ideation is a 123-foot-long luxury superyacht capable of morphing into a submarine for the freakin’ wealthy. Dubbed the Nautilus, the future-forward watercraft’s blueprint was revealed at the Monaco Yacht Show. The inspiration for the design comes from Jules Verne’s science fiction novel “20,000 Leagues Under the Sea” which ignited the possibility of a luxury yacht 150 years ago.",

The maximum depth the vessel can dive without any problem is 656 feet, so one can expect to explore unprecedented underwater life like never seen before on a personal watercraft. According to U-Boat Worx chairman and founder Bert Houtman, Nautilus will change the complexion of “the yachting market” and it’ll “never be the same again.”",
            "The luxury carrier comes with four staterooms for passengers, quarters for the six crew members, and the owner gets to stay in the flamboyant main suite. There’s a dining room, full galley, lounge area with panoramic windows under the water line, and a whole lot of modern amenities to make the stay rememberable. When above the water, the craft has a huge sundeck, freshwater pool, a bar and an alfresco dining table to bask in luxury for summer holidays. For underwater divers, there’s a pressure-resistant electric tender called the Aronnax. It can ferry up to five seafarers, and the all-electric tender boat is stored below the aft desk when the superyacht takes a dive underwater.",
            "Nautilus can cruise underwater for six hours in one go, and stay put underwater for four straight days – just in case you have apprehensions of a future apocalypse on land. This makes for a perfect escape when the seas are too rough for the superyacht to float safely. We are super excited as U-Boat Worx promises deliveries for Nautilus within 30 months with a price tag of $24.5 million. Since, it doubles as two vessels in one, that exorbitant price tag is more than justified!"

A few years ago, they promised an electric sports car is coming the automotive lovers’ way, and even amid the heavy air of speculation, they’ve finally done it.",
            "Ariel has released the first ever electric vehicle that looks nothing like a conventional EV would. In fact, it is more inclined towards the Batmobile genre, so it could also be portrayed as a clean-energy vehicle for the vigilante, it’s that freakin’ badass!",
            "Designer: Ariel",
            "This stealth supercar dubbed HIPECAR comes with the promise of High Performance Carbon Reduction (that’s where the name convention comes from) without giving up on agility and lightweight characteristics too much. For now, the sportscar is in the prototype stage and the first production version will be released in a couple of years’ time.",
            "The supercar having aluminum monocoque with carbon-fiber body parts will have a Cosworth-sourced 62-kilowatt-hour battery capable of powering the beast for a range of 150 miles. The option to peak this figure will come in the form of a Cosworth turbine range extender producing 35 kW of power. HIPECAR will be available in the all-wheel drive option, with four motors for each wheel delivering a total of 1,1180 horsepower, or the rear-wheel drive with two motors. Top end trim of the sportscar will be capable of going from 0-60 mph in just 2.09 seconds flat and 100 mph in 4.4 seconds. Ariel is confident that with the torque vectoring system these numbers could be bettered.",
            "The body and chassis of the HIPECAR are more advanced compared to the likes of Atom and Nomad. The total weight of HIPECAR will be approximately 3,307 pounds for the all-wheel drive variant and 3,086 pounds for the normal version. The suspension has a variable-sized double wishbone structure and there are AP Racing brakes get the six pistons at the front and four at the back. Since we are talking of a track-performance sports car, the driver will have regenerative braking, adjustable traction control and torque vectoring at disposal.",

The vertical fins at each corner and the centerline of the rear deck along with the roof-mounted scoop for airflow help achieve all the performance.",

For people in North America, there’s no good news as the sports car might not show up in this part of the world.

The car gets nifty alterations to completely change the perception of a classic four-wheeler. There’s a sense of airiness to the interiors with the pillar size reduced and the sunroof more dynamic to liven up things. The headlamps and the taillight get a more aggressive treatment to reinforce the aggressive stance. The same goes for the diamond-cut finish wheels that add to the edgy personality of the otherwise contoured EV.",

            "When I first saw the press images of the Ferrari Purosangue, my eyes immediately focused on the prancing horse badges; this car is nothing more than a sleek and sexy-looking sports car without them. Why? Because it’s ludicrous for anyone to believe Ferrari would build an “SUV.” Of course, they’ll deny that this is an SUV or a crossover. Fortunately, before your eyes are Ferrari’s first-ever four-door, four-seater hatchback body style that their customers have been asking for, so as you can imagine, Ferrari had no choice but to build it.",
            "From my standpoint, the Purosangue, which means thoroughbred in Italian, is deep down a Ferrari first, which happens to seat a family of four on a road trip. The new form-factor is unlike any other Ferrari built in the past, including the all-wheel-drive shooting brake.",
            "Because the Purosangue is a Ferrari, one can expect nothing less than out-of-this-world performance. It’s powered by the company’s legendary naturally-aspirated mid-front mounted, 6.5-liter V12 engine, sending 715 hp, 528 lb-ft of torque to all four wheels. It’s matted with an eight-speed dual-clutch transmission mounted at the rear axle. According to Ferrari, 0-60 takes less than 3.3-seconds. That’s quick for a 4,600-pound vehicle.",
            "Unlike Lamborghini, Bentley, Audi Sport, and even Aston Martin, rear-seated passengers are treated to easier ingress and egress thanks to the coach doors, a rear-hinged design that opens with a 79-degree swing. This styling is rare in modern times, except for Rolls-Royce. I personally find this element distinctive, showcasing a more inviting style and character. It allowed for a shorter wheelbase while elevating the Purosangue into its class.",
            "The design elements on the Purosangue scream track-ready, sporting a ready-to-pounce stance from front to back. Starting with dimensions, the length is 195.7 inches, 79.8 inches wide, and 62.6 inches tall. No other Ferrari is even close to the size of the Purosangue. Even so, it’s visually compact looking with curves in all the right places, such as around the wheel arches, allowing for an athletic physique.",
            "Looking at the front closely reveals the lack of a front grille, replaced by a dihedral suspended on the lower section. The camera and parking sensors are cleverly housed between two shells integrated seamlessly into the car’s shape. The integration of the headlights and daytime running lights which double as turn signals, is set between two pairs of air intakes, melded into the upper part of the flanks. This is by far one of my favorite design elements on the car.",
            "Around the back, this is one of the cleanest rear-ends I’ve laid eyes on, and it’s all good. The diffuser looks great but lends to this clean look while providing downforce. Like other EV SUVs, the rear window doesn’t need a wiper, thanks to the natural flow of air. The rear cargo area measures 17 cubic feet, but the rear seats fold flat to expand capacity.",
            "On the inside, there’s a 10.2-inch digital gauge cluster for the driver and a dedicated display for the front passenger. A third central infotainment display would clutter up the space, but I’d personally miss not having it for things like maps or turning the radio.",
            "Since this is one of the most luxurious “not-an-SUV” money can buy, one can expect to spec out materials such as leather, and Alcantara, including carbon fiber. The carbon-fiber roof comes standard, or select the option for a glass roof with electrochromic tint adjustment.",
            "As expected, demand for the Purosangue will be high when it goes on sale late next year. Even at the base price of $400,000, it’s not likely one can stroll into a local Ferrari dealership and drive off with one."

The front section is covered completely in the body frame molded out of a single piece of metal. That gives the electric wheel hub motor-powered scooter an elongated retro feel. From the rear, the Nano looks like a modern moped in its best possible version, and will surely appeal to the young crowd.",
            "Bandit 9 claims that the electric motor requires little or no maintenance at all which is another advantage to owning it. The Nano base model comes for a price tag of $4,499 and the Nano+ version costs a bit more at $4,990.

The engine comes with a six-speed manual transmission mated to a robust dual-mass flywheel. One interesting feature of the seventh-generation muscle car is the ability to remotely rev the engine with the key fob for bragging rights!",
            "Ford has not let a word out on how much the 2024 Mustang will cost when finally rolled out in 2023, but it should be more akin to the outgoing versions. The current base EcoBoost model is priced at $29,000 and the top-end trim goes for $57,000."

            "Meet Hydra, an e-bike with a difference. Unlike traditional electric motorcycles that rely on a powertrain that pulls energy from a lithium-ion battery, Hydra offers an alternate, much more experimental solution – hydrogen fuel cells. Although still in its infancy, hydrogen fuel cells promise absolutely clean energy. Unlike gasoline-powered engines, the fuel cells have zero harmful emissions, and unlike traditional lithium-ion battery EVs, hydrogen fuel cells do away with toxic battery acids that can potentially wreak havoc on the environment if not disposed of properly. In fact, when fueled with pure hydrogen, the only by-products are heat and water (hence the name Hydra), making the technology a zero-emission, sustainable power source.",

The Hydra is undeniably cyberpunk, with the clever use of straight lines to define forms and curves only to round off edges. The bike isn’t lithe or aerodynamic, but rather has an almost robotic appeal with its affinity for straight lines and simple geometric shapes. Hydra’s front is dominated by a large block which serves as the hydrogen fuel cell. The engine sits right below the cantilever seat, powering the rear wheel directly.",
            "The Hydra sports a beautiful translucent fairing, which reveals the complexities inside and provides the perfect contrast against the other carbon fiber components used around the e-bike.",
            "A look at the Hydra under its fairing gives a better idea of its underlying tech. Even for a motorcycle that’s entirely conceptual at the moment, the level of detail and planning gone into executing this design is just staggering."

The designers looked beyond the mere commute needs, and also focus on the utility aspect of vehicles. For example, the needs of shopkeepers, delivery providers, packers & movers, entrepreneurs, vendors, restaurateurs and more. To make it easy for a wide array of needs propping up by these individuals, the ANT can morph shape and add to its utility by three folds or even more.",

So, any of these individuals don’t need to buy separate vehicles for different tasks.  Being nimble and highly functional is the key to the concept’s success if the idea ever meets fruition. The concept is centered on the base panels and building blocks which bring greater versatility and freedom of all the possible combinations. The rented or purchased configuration modules can be retrofitted at mini-factories on demand.",

Based on the chassis of a Ford Model T, the unique motorhome was built before the first World War and was restored to its original specification later in the 1970s. It has now exchanged hands one more time at a recent Bonhams auction.",

The new owner remains undisclosed but the oldest known motor caravan definitely deserves a deeper look at it irrespective of who gets to live in it. For starters, built on the Ford Model T chassis, lengthened and strengthened slightly by Baico, the caravan is simply homelike on the inside thanks to the all-wooden interiors. The caravan body is designed and built by Dunton of Reading, and the interiors were restored to original rightfulness in the ‘70s after it was abandoned almost for half a century by the owners of this miraculous home on wheels in the 1920s.",

Owing to the restoration work that renders the caravan to its original form, it was entered into the HCVC London-Brighton Run in the year of restoration and it – little surprisingly – won seven awards which comprised the recognition for being a motorhome in best original condition.",
            "The Ford Model T Motor Caravan is spacious and has four berths in the living area, a wood-burning stove, leather bench for driver and passengers with internal storage that can swivel around to offer additional space in the living area. However, despite that spaciousness, it lacks a bathroom and running water. The liveable space is nicely furnished with green velvet curtains and can offer a homely feeling for the residents like you and me only when it goes under the hammer the next time. Until then, let’s just hope all is good for the new owner who’s shelled off almost twice the estimated price for this mark of ancient history."

Bandit9 originally set out to build a car that captures the joy of riding a motorcycle, but the team found them slipping down the racecar rabbit hole. The Monaco is a result of their growing obsession with racecars and captures everything the ‘religion of racing’ epitomizes – speed, aerodynamism, power, control, and the thrill of feeling the resistance as you push against the pedal and try to maneuver a hunk of metal hurtling across the asphalt.",

The more Bandit9 learned about the science and religion of Racing, the more they felt compelled to honor those that came before by continuing their work; Colin Chapman’s relentless mission to reduce weight, Carroll Shelby’s principles on control over pure power, Enzo Ferrari’s philosophy on life, and more.",
            "“While modern sports cars come packed with features, the truth is they’ve made you dependent”, says the Bandit9 team. “With GPS, there’s no need to have a sense of direction; cruise control means you just need to steer, and now with autopilot: you’re barely driving; just call an Uber.” In that sense, the Monaco is both an attempt at capturing the old-school meaning of racing, albeit with new-age technology, thanks to Bandit9’s diverse team of aerospace, robotics, mechatronics, and chemical engineers working alongside their roster of international automotive designers.",
            "The Monaco is an F1-worthy racecar powered by an electric heart. The car comes with a carbon fiber monocoque that sports Bandit9’s signature fluid-inspired bodywork on top.

It uses the same electric engine and LFP batteries as a Tesla Model S, which helps the Monaco output over 536 horses and 445 lb-ft of torque, going from 0-60 in 2.7 secs and covering 250 miles on a single charge – that’s an entire F1 race without worrying about battery levels.",
            "Designing a racecar is a challenge… designing an electric racecar is virtual martyrdom, however, the Monaco seems to have nailed that practically impossible brief. Like Formula 1 cars, the Monaco’s engine and batteries are positioned in the rear to transfer the immense power of the engine to the track. Their weight pushes the wheels into the ground providing more downforce and reducing the chances of wheel spin. And with the free space up front, that just gives the designer more freedom to create a gloriously aerodynamic nose that slices through the air like a lightsaber through cotton candy.",
            "At its top speeds of 250km/h, the driver will experience up to 2 g’s when they accelerate and up to 4 g’s banking into corners or braking. The car’s cockpit, in that regard, feels more like sitting in the pilot’s seat of a fighter jet. “Like any athlete, you’ll have to train to maintain control”, the Bandit9 team says.",
            "An ultrawide tactical camera outputs a panoramic rear view on the driver’s dashboard at 1080p with low latency, giving them a much clearer view of what’s behind them while they’re racing.",
            "For people with deep pockets and a license to vroom, the Monaco starts at $150,000 USD and ships worldwide, with deliveries beginning in Q3 of 2023. Before that, the Bandit9 team is heading to the salt flats with a modified version of the Monaco to attempt a world record.

The latter will have 467 km/h (290 mph) top speed, and 2,950 hp while the former gets 526 km/h (327 mph) top speed.",

So, we perceive it as a green commuting option for riders who seek driving pleasure and styling. He also added that the design came about to be after their team identified the gaps in the automotive market currently. From there the opportunities were identified to design a trike to fill the void.",

You can use as many as 8 Firefly lights with one bicycle, and the Lumos app lets you assign a location to each Firefly simply by dragging and dropping it onto a grid – so each individual light is aware of its location, be it the front or back, or the left or right.

The lights aren’t just multi-colored or wireless – they’re capable of automatically synchronizing too. The team at Lumos arrived at the fact that the best way to convey visibility was to have lights flickering in unison, rather than a scatter of sparkling LEDs. To that end, multiple Firefly lights can pair up with each other and blink at exactly the same time, conveying visibility without distracting the rider or people around.",
            "This synchronization happens with multiple Fireflies on the same bike as well as with a host of Firefly lights on different bicycles that are moving together – a feature the Lumos folks call Team Sync. They even coordinate with the lights on your Lumos helmet, creating a tight ecosystem of products that just deliver exactly as intended. What’s more impressive is that multiple lights paired together will also switch off together when you switch one of them off – so you don’t need to go manually turning 8 lights off at the end of a ride.",

The mounting system lets you magnetically snap the light on when you need to use it, and take it off when you’re done (so that they don’t get stolen).

The XC’s design boasts of a similar cleanness but doesn’t distort the car’s silhouette to the extent the Cybertruck does. It’s minimal without being abstract, is what I’m trying to say. The Volvo XC comes with simple 3D surfaces, punctuated by parting lines galore that add their own distinct flavor to the car. The headlights are almost a hat-tip to Polestar’s automobiles – although that isn’t really much of a surprise considering Volvo is Polestar’s parent brand. The taillights, on the other hand, feel unmistakably Polestar.",
            "The Volvo XC concept gets its name from the XC90, which it shares its wheelbase with. However, unlike the XC90 which hugs the tarmac, the latter hs much higher ground clearance, rivaling the 2021 Ford Bronco. The inspiration for the XC’s aesthetic has strong roots in Scandinavian minimalism – a distinct design ethos that’s arguably one of Sweden’s biggest contributions to the world of design. In that pursuit of minimalism, the XC does take quite a few cues from its sibling, the Polestar Precept. Especially the nude metallic finish, the embracing of dynamic parting lines, and even the car’s rims, which are a hat-tip to the Swedish flag’s design.",

There are two rows of seats on each side in one configuration with elements incorporated to bring an airy feel to the interiors.",

These wheels can move individually for tight city commuting or parking in tight spots.  There’s a skateboard-like chassis that makes the wheelbase and wheeltrack reconfigurable. Thus, the pod can also be assembled together to have more platform space, for it to be used as a lounge area, gaming space, or a makeshift motel. That’s if someone wants to buy it for personal use. The possibilities are limitless.",

            "Designed by Cumpert Contraptions, this custom BMW build is just that – an oddball contraption that captivates the eye with its retropunk demeanor. Resting on three wheels instead of the usual two, this quirky beauty once used to be a 1992-model BMW R100R Mystic, which Tim Cumpert got his hands on for his mad-scientist project. He sawed the front off, replacing it with a chassis taken from an ATV, and built out his vision using that as his framework. “The three-wheeler was inspired by pre-war racing cars, which I am a big fan of,” he told Bike EXIF. “When I started this project back in 2012, Morgan had just released their new 3 Wheeler. But the main drive for this project, was that I wanted to try my hand at sheet aluminum fabrication.”",
            "Designer: Tim Cumpert",
            "Cumpert’s fascination with aluminum fabrication really defines his project’s overall aesthetic. The pre-war energy is strong with the exposed sheeting and visible rivets all along the side of the vehicle. Cumpert started off with sketches, which he then made a 3D CAD file of and CNC-machined to a 1:3 scale. This helped him iron out any kinks and build the large wooden blocks that he would then use to hammer out his aluminum sheet on.",
            "As one could imagine, simply gluing an ATV to a motorcycle isn’t quite an elegant or functional solution. However, both the frames were luckily the same width, which made it pretty easy to line them up. Most of the ATV’s front end is still intact, including its steering linkage, suspension arms and shocks. The hybrid bike (although not your conventional hybrid) uses the ATV brakes on the front and the BMW brakes on the rear too.",
            "The bike’s 3-wheel format isn’t the first thing you notice about the bike, though… it’s the unique low-hung frame. It somewhat resembles the BMW Alpha by Mehmet Doruk Erdem with its crouching appearance and front-heavy torso. The boxer motor sits a little more towards the front than usual, but is complemented perfectly by the two wheels ahead of it that really help distribute the mass in an elegant way. In order to really drive home the vintage racecar aesthetic, the 3-wheeler also uses a repurposed Kawasaki Versys windscreen on the front, and sticks to a relatively nude paint job, with just a flash of red near the seat.",
            "“This is my first sheet metal project,” says Tim Cumpert, “so I designed the shape of the three-wheeler to be mainly simple forms. Most of the body was made using a roller, while the front grill and side pods were hammered over MDF bucks, with a bit of English wheeling to smooth things up. The most tricky part was the rear section, which is made from around six parts.”",
            "The bike’s more of an exploration of possibilities rather than being something that’s essentially road-legal. Cumpert mentions that driving it takes getting used to, especially the handling, considering its 3-wheeled format. “It will lift a wheel on cornering, so you need to move your weight towards the inside wheel when turning”, he says. “I have a list of handling mods to try now. I think the seat needs lowering and handle bars rising a bit to make it easier to move around and see where you’re going, plus I’d like to try an anti-roll bar on the front.”",

It gets a hybrid powertrain having a diesel generator and 1,200 horsepower, an electric motor powering the waterjet propulsion system. In the electric mode, Kronos can be operational for 36 hours to maintain vital electrical systems and most importantly air supply. The recharging time of the battery and air refueling is 1.5 hours which is good considering the size of it. The diesel engine can also kick in to add another 18 hours of autonomy if the electric battery tops out.",
            "On the inside, the submarine gets air-conditioning and an adaptive lighting system. Overall, the inside space is spacious for passengers to not feel claustrophobic. For now, the thing is allegedly under construction with a picture of the main body under the shell in the works. There’s no more information other than this for now, but we are waiting to see the swift monster take shape and scout the waters in the coming years."

            "A stunning flight of fancy and a peek into Lincoln’s budding future, the Model L100 Concept car is unlike anything I’ve seen this year. A wildly crafty electric concept car inspired by the brand’s very first luxury sedan, the 1922 Model L, it is fit for a sci-fi movie debut to be precise. The “100” in the namesake marks the 100th anniversary of the brand, and what a time to debut such an eye-popping creation.",
            "According to Joy Falotico, president, Lincoln; “With the Model L100 Concept, we reimagine what the Lincoln sanctuary can look like for our clients of tomorrow and take a big step toward our next chapter.” And I totally agree, as it’s been deemed a featured marque of the ongoing Pebble Beach Concours d’Elegance in Monterey.",

Highly tailored for aerodynamic efficiency, this Lincoln concept is made to be larger than life, literally. The integrated headlamps take a U-shape following the circumference of the glass hood and the elongated roofline fuses into the rear. The upper backend of the car lifts entirely along with the doors which creates a never-before-seen luxury space on a concept. And yes, how could I forget to mention the jewel-inspired chess piece controller (for a steering wheel) that according to Lincoln “captures light and depth by redefining the vehicle controls inside the cabin.” Since the four-wheeler will be mostly autonomous, the owner won’t need much of the fancy yoke.",
            "The interiors are as luxurious and future-forward as they could get. There are vegan-free inserts, soft white seats complemented by recycled suede, a digital floor and a canopy projecting animated scenes on the floor and ceiling.  The front row seats flip over to face the rear passengers for a social-centric lounging experience. The maker likes to refer to this one as an opulent “personal sanctuary” cabin.",
            "Model L100 is not just about hypnotic looks on the outside as well as inside, as it comes with a next-generation battery cell and packs technology for advanced electric performance. Although Lincoln doesn’t detail the exact specifications of the electric drivetrain, I assume it’s going to be powerful and energy efficient."

Mind you, the platform robot can go at a top speed of 2.6m/s which is impressive. Add to that the IP5 water resistance, and the RANGER can tread any terrain with ease. So, we can add autonomous home deliveries also to the equation.",
            "AgileX Robotics has tested the four-wheeled autonomous robot in a diverse set of conditions – for example, hilly roads, gravel paths, and even stairs. In the prototype test runs, the RANGER easily took on slopes of 10 degrees and 10 cm high obstacles.",

Most of the existing canopies on the market are rigid and centered around a specific scooter, however, the Scooterpac is a unique bolt-on solution that can be deployed as and when needed. An innovative multi-stage folding mechanism allows the canopy to be attached and removed whenever required.",
            "Integrating Scooterpac to your mobility scooter is an extremely simple process. You simply remove its protective cover and move the frame into position – at the top of the scooter. You can then pull down the windscreen, and secure it to the front protection panel. You then proceed to pull out the sides and zip them across the scooter. The canopy is now ready to use! You can enter the scooter, by unzipping it from one side.",
            "The designers worked extensively with textile manufacturers to create and design custom soft materials that are reliable, premium-quality, and completely waterproof. When it came to designing the Scooterpac – safety was something that was highly focused upon. Since the Scooterpac employs a mechanism with huge levers, it was essential to ensure that product does not pose any risk of injury. International compliance regulations for finger traps and pinch points were referenced, to ensure that the product causes the minimum amount of damage to any user.",

            "Plenty of people have taken up biking or cycling recently, some to live a healthier lifestyle, others to escape the traffic of congested highways. Not all bikes are created equal, of course, and most are not equipped to handle different kinds of terrain. Even those that you could use to get to work and back aren’t always ready to face longer treks or rougher roads. Electric bicycles (not to be confused with electric scooters) can give you a leg up in terms of distance, but battery life and power will be perpetual concerns on the road. Whether you’re biking for sport or for work, you will probably want a bike that can handle anything and get you to your destination in comfort and in one piece, which is exactly what this monster of an E-bike brings to the table.",

            "Unlike purely motorized personal transportation like e-scooters, e-bikes combine battery power and leg power to get you places. It’s probably because of that factor that many e-bikes tend to skimp on the motorized parts in favor of a lighter and skinnier body. After all, you can always pedal your way completely if the battery does finally give out. Definitely plausible but hardly ideal, especially if you’re trekking roads that even your mighty legs will have trouble going through. The ENGWE X26 all-terrain e-bike, in contrast, gives you all the power you need to conquer any road and almost any distance.",
            "Conquer Hills with Ease – A 1000W gives you the comfort to glide over sand and gravel without stop and deal with mud and mountains with ease.",
            "The ENGWE X26’s power comes from two features that are industry firsts for this type of electric vehicle. For one, it has a powerful 1000W motor capable of pushing your speed to 31 mph max. While that’s the maximum power it can dish out, the e-bike also delivers a steady and reliable 750W output that still outruns the average e-bike’s 500W motors. All this power makes short work of rough terrains and inclines, which means that you’ll also be gliding swiftly on smoother pavement.",
            "Climb 30% Inclines – The 1000W motor pushes it up hills just like they were flat ground.",
            "Go from A to Z Faster – The 1000W motor gives it a 31MPH top speed, beating other eBikes that only reach 20-30MPH.",
            "Range Up to 62 Miles – The main battery gives you a full 48 miles, while a second swappable battery adds another 14 miles to your trip.",
            "That heavy-duty motor naturally requires more power, and the ENGWE X26 delivers a whopping 1373Wh for that purpose. The secret to this trick is the two batteries inside, one 48V/19A pack standing vertically beneath the rider’s seat and a removable 48V/9.6A battery inside the top tube. Together, the two deliver a 62-mile range that’s 1.5 times more than your typical e-bike, and you can even go the distance by swapping out a spare battery.",

            "Triple Suspension System – Integrated with solid fat tires for the maximum robust and exciting ride.",
            "The ENGWE X26’s power doesn’t come at the sacrifice of comfort and convenience. 26in x 4in motorcycle-grade fat tires give you the best grip on the road, handling the triple threats of gravel, potholes, and rocky terrains with ease. A triple shock suspension system also makes short work of bumpy rides, absorbing shock three times better than the competition. The Shimano 8-speed gearbox lets you easily pick the sweet spot between performance and efficiency.",
            "Given everything that it packs, the ENGWE X26 isn’t the lightest e-bike on the market, but that doesn’t make it any less portable. Its lightweight aluminum frame can be folded in half, giving access to the removable battery and allowing for easy storage. The e-bike isn’t lacking in safety features either, with a bright headlight and powerful break lights that can be a literal lifesaver in the dark. And to top it all off, there’s a built-in large LCD display to bring you up to speed on your speed, distance, and remaining battery.",
            "The ENGWE X26 All-Terrain E-Bike is designed to be a greener alternative to cars and is built to perform just like one, too. In that context, the $1,599 price tag almost feels like a steal, especially if you’re able to avail of the super early bird discount. Just like this e-bike, ENGWE is also aggressive in its schedule, having shipped the first consolidated batch to the US and the UK last June, with local deliveries in Hong Kong starting in late August. The second batch has already started mass production, and consolidated shipping is expected to begin in August to bring this groundbreaking e-bike to backers.",

Likewise, John Wick could very well do with a boxy motorbike rather than hopping on that Yamaha MT-09 featured in Chapter 3, don’t you think?

Although the actor admits he’s never played the game himself, so I weighed in towards the John Wick link more than the virtual world association. Also, this makes logical sense too as Cyberpunk 2077 didn’t turn out to be the same cake it was mustered up to be.",
            "This rimless bike goes perfectly with the actor’s persona and has a kind of front-dominated body presence. The geometrically shaped bike has a square gas tank that makes up for the headlight section as well. The beamers have a subdued filter on them to portray that grim look, and I don’t mind that at all. The rear is more trimmed down but still geometric nonetheless. Visually the bike seems glued to the tarmac and exudes a jacked-up look. Other than that, this ride has that typical grunge factor that’ll make it perfect for a John Wick Chapter 4 appearance."

During the normal course, the EV can be a travel buddy for two or used for short hauls of cargo delivery given the ability to convert into a load carrier. The latter is achieved with the different modules that give the owners freedom to carry a bicycle, sensitive cargo, or simply luggage for the next couple trip to the rockies.",
            "The concept car looks quite tough while retaining a very cheeky element of modern that you’ll appreciate. The dimensions look apt for tight urban spaces and the respectable ride height is reassurance for short out-of-city adventures. The peculiar V-shaped body leaves room for ample cargo in the back when the delivery module is attached. The off-roading avatar of the PIX-L7 is what I’m rooting for here owing to the possibility of taking this ride for an adventure unknown. Just look at that cool shape evoked by the bull bars and the shovel on the front!"

            "Designer: BluOasis",

The deployable solar panels on the rooftop would be nothing without matching power storage. The BluMobile trailer puts power storage on the forefront with a 15kWh lithium-iron-phosphate battery pack.",
            "BluMobile trailer is primarily designed as an off-grid base camp of sorts for adventurers or perhaps a tiny accommodation with requisite supplies on a remote job site. The trailer features 4,250 liters of internal storage that can accommodate your equipment and cargo. As an RV it also makes room for up to four people to sleep in. The additional room for a queen-size bed (besides a double bed below) is made possible with the pop-up roof.",
            "It’s not the most comfortable trailer, but for off-grid living, the BluMobile uses BluOasis’s water generator which condenses humidity from the air and runs the separated water through a UV-enabled filtration system. At about 60 percent of humidity, the atmospheric water generator can generate 38 liters of drinking water in a day, which can be stored in an onboard 150 liters tank.",
            "The power requirement for remote working, cooking, and overnight parties is all taken care of by the interesting electrical setup connected to the solar panels and storage batteries. Without the solar panels, the BluMobile starts at $24,500. The cost of the trailer appropriate for permanent off-grid families – increases with add-ons and customization."

Charging on the road is still a problem, and there are issues even with charging at home. Being able to charge your car during the night while it’s parked in your garage should be an advantage that regular cars would never be able to enjoy, but it isn’t all sunshine and roses because of a multitude of factors. That’s where Autel’s new HomeCharger comes in, making EV charging so easy you’d wish your phone or laptop charged that way, too.",

For just 60 minutes of charging, you can get a range of 30 miles for your car. That means you can simply hook it up when you get home and wake up to a fully charged EV waiting for you.",
            "EV owners might have some misgivings about having a charger at home because of safety concerns. The MaxiCharger is specifically designed to allay those fears, making it safe to use both indoors and outdoors. IP65 rating makes it resistant to the harshest rains, and it can operate within a temperature range of -40°C to 55°C (-40°F to 131°F), so snow and summer heat are no problems either. The AC Wallbox also has excellent heat dissipation, removing worries of overheating and fire risks to your home.",
            "While these qualities make the Autel MaxiCharger safe and reliable, its smart features make it convenient and painless to use. Like almost any smart home appliance these days, you can monitor and control all of the Wallbox’s functions from the comfort of your smartphone, whether manually or automatically. What makes the Autel app even more impressive, however, are the insights it can provide to make your charging even smarter. You can check the power consumption and even the electricity cost so that you can make better decisions when to charge your EV to save as much money as possible. The MaxiCharge also boasts Adaptive Load Management (ALM), so you don’t have to worry about overcurrent trips and allowing it to schedule charging times depending on electricity prices and power grid utilization.",
            "Many car makers like to flaunt visions of the future of travel, which often involve not just electric vehicles but self-driving ones as well. These “drives” of fantasy don’t always show the hassles of charging these vehicles, especially at home, where conditions are very different from public charging piles. That could be a major deterrent to the adoption of EVs, but the Autel MaxiCharger AC Wallbox offers convenience, reliability, and efficiency to make those worries go away. And as more people switch to greener cars, companies like Autel will lead the search for smarter, more power-efficient charging solutions to truly make green energy power the future.",

            "Electric bike startups are popping up more frequently than ever – pitching economic means of transport without harming the environment. The London-based creative agency Layer Design has impressed us at Yanko Design with their creations, and their latest two-wheeler conceptual urban e-bike is no different.",
            "The electric bicycle is built to be safer on the roads, ideal of modern lifestyle and better in performance than other options on the market. Christened the Pendler bike, it gets the name from Danish word pendling (meaning commuting), and is a nod to the country’s deep cycling culture.",
            "Designer: Layer Design",
            "The idea of this concept is centered on the U-shaped frame which is basically a thick structural element. This lends the two-wheeler an identifiable silhouette for on-off urban riding needs. Aesthetics and feasible performance of the Pendler are given much attention which is important for a design to materialize for mass production.",
            "45Nm electric motor on the e-bike is concealed well within the frame and the detachable timber accessories add a dimension of practical usefulness to the e-bike. Layer Design has been mindful enough to bring built-in solutions to problems cyclists come across. Things such as bike storage or communication with surrounding traffic. According to Benjamin Hubert the creation solves a number of predicaments of daily city commute while keeping the tech driven positioning and aesthetics intact.",
            "Pendler folds down flat for easy storage since handlebar rotates 90 degrees to align with the main frame and the pedals fold down flat. The wheels have been kept down to 20-inches to keep up the compact theme – good enough to carry on a public transport too. Modularity comes in the form of detachable and modular baskets on the front and rear. This gives rider the flexibility to add or remove these add-ons as per need.",
            "The communication aspect is taken care of by the phone dock for navigation, height adjustable saddle and indicator lights on the handlebar. This way the rider doesn’t have to put his/her hand out to alarm other motorists. Pendler is powered by a swappable 25Wh battery that churns out 70 km range on single charge and top speed of 25 km/h."

Coming from the VW China team, V.MO was created in partnership with London-based studio Tangerine and Sunward, a China-based aviation manufacturer, helped build the first-ever prototype. “In 2020, Volkswagen Group China launched a Vertical Mobility project to explore the next generation of mobility solutions, including the urban air mobility market and the extension of urban traffic into airspace”, said Volkswagen in a press release. “After intensive research, conceptual work, and development, the project team has now developed its first validation model – the V.MO.”",
            "Designers: Tangerine & VW Group China",
            "Internally referred to as the Flying Tiger (to mark its launch in 2022, the year of the tiger), the V.MO is targeted toward China’s elite as a high-end travel concept made for travel between Chinese megacities for business and leisure. Volkswagen and Tangerine interviewed as many as 100 potential clients who fit the V.MO’s target audience description, which helped inform the overall eVTOL’s design.",
            "The prototype concept is based on existing autonomous driving solutions and battery technology for emission-free mobility. With a luxury X-wing configuration of 11.2m in length and a span width of 10.6m, the model features eight rotors for vertical lift and two rear propellers that enable horizontal flight. In its final future iteration, the fully electric and automated eVTOL could eventually carry four passengers plus luggage over a distance of up to 200km.",
            "Although VW Group’s just unveiled this one concept, the company has also revealed its ambitious plan to ramp up production and build several other prototypes. The Group will conduct several flight tests later this year to optimize the concept and an improved prototype will undergo further advanced test flights by late summer of 2023. For now, this one-off prototype is targeted at “private ownership”, Volkswagen claims, although future prototypes and iterations will explore different use-cases and ownership models."

The conceptual two-wheeler is remarkably lithe yet not traditionally aerodynamic. It plays with volumes rather wonderfully, just the way the Cybertruck did, and always opts for simpler surfaces rather than complicated ones. Couple this with that rather cold and calculating light-strip headlight, and the silver paint job and the NUPO looks like the electric motorcycle we wish Tesla would make already.",

The rather large-ish mass on the front acts as the housing for the battery, which occupies the most space in any e-bike over other components, and even gives the motorbike its central weight to create the kind of balance needed while riding. Although details are scant considering this is just a concept, it’s safe to say that the NUPO has a rear-wheel motor (visible in the first image), and charges electrically via a port located right where you’d expect a traditional motor cycle’s fuel-tank inlet to be. The e-bike boasts of a metallic design that’s wonderfully proportioned and balanced by split surfacing and the use of black accents on the motorbike’s predominantly silver design. The Cybertruck’s windows and windshield helped cut the EV’s mass, and given that motorbikes don’t have that luxury, NUBO uses the seat and parts of its fairing to help split surfaces and cut the bulk.",
            "The electric motorcycle market is yet to see the kind of explosion the EV industry is having. Sure, companies like BMW Motorrad and Ducati are playing their small roles, but for the most part, a majority of motorcycles are still gas-powered. The conditions are perfect for Tesla to disrupt this space too (one could argue that their tech is already pretty capable and two-wheelers are easier to manufacture than cars), but it doesn’t quite seem like Elon is much of a biker!"

The autonomous vehicle keeps a tab on the number of honeybees in the artificial colony cocooned inside, and the real-time temperature levels. The entrance to the beehive at the bottom of the vehicle can be opened or closed as desired for the bees to pollinate the designated area. To keep off the hornets from decimating the honey producers, there’s a trap on top that sends off the scent of the hive to attract the insects. This keeps the main hive away from harm’s way.",

The company’s appropriately-sized fleet of aircrafts for appropriate packages will share the company’s existing design philosophy, which the company has been testing globally by way of Hummingbird – its flagship drone. Wing claims this drone can carry up to 2 pounds and has made thousands of delivers across the globe.",

The name in the context of the car is a hat-tip to Polestar’s global mission of championing sustainability by recycling parts of its automobiles. The company’s recent car, the Precept, was hailed for creating a recycling system for aluminum, and also for also using 100% recycled plastic to weave the yarn used inside the car’s interiors. Cladrus, even though a concept, champions that attitude too by hinting at the use of recycled metals and plastics in the entire car.",

Designer Harshul Verma used simple, edgy forms to create the car’s delicate balance and dynamic volumes. The Cladrus comes with a sprawling sun-roof that goes from front all the way to the back. Given that there’s no traditional driver or cockpit, transparency and visibility weren’t a pressing issue. Instead, the car provides a panoramic roof that illuminates the interiors, and ditches the windows (and even doors) altogether to create a sense of privacy.",

The Cladrus comfortably seats 4, and can fit as many as 5 passengers within. A sofa and two armchairs create a wonderful luxurious in-car experience – an experience that’s only further heightened by the Cladrus’ wood-panel flooring.",
            "Verma posits that his concept hopes to redefine EVs. Not only does the Polestar Cladrus run (at least supplementally) on solar power, but the power is supplied to graphene-based batteries instead of the traditional lithium-ion ones. Since graphene can be used as a supercapacitor, the solar panels end up being much more efficient, and Verma mentions that graphene enables the solar panels to directly power the car, instead of routing it through the battery. Any extra energy that isn’t immediately used by the car gets stored in its battery, allowing Cladrus to run at night too. The designer doesn’t mention if there’s an ability to charge the car traditionally, but considering Polestar comes from Sweden which sees a dramatic decrease in solar energy during the winters, one would expect the concept car to have some sort of failsafe!"

            "To make the investment put into your exercise bike more worthwhile it needs to serve some other purpose too. So, what better than having a Motocompo-like two-wheeler that is a compact commuter by day time, and an exercise bike when it is time to get in the zone and flex those muscles.",
            "Designer: Raymond Wu",
            "Meet the GYMO-FIT concept motorbike that has the typical urban commuter vibes, and a sturdy exercise bike to keep fit. The uncertain times in the last couple of years have prompted people to go for home fitness setups – that’s why exercise bikes have grown in popularity in recent times. But as I said, the excitement to use this fitness equipment quickly fades away. So, isn’t that a waste of money?",
            "This concept bike doubles as a two-wheeler at least, and doesn’t sit in a lonely corner in your living room, in case you give up on your fitness regime. It’s a combination of an electric bike with aerobic and anaerobic fitness equipment. GYMO has three different modes when parked sturdily on the stand. It has the obvious exercise bike mode for strengthening the leg muscle group, rowing machine mode for working out the back and shoulder muscles, and the abdominal exerciser for strengthening the core.",
            "In the rowing and abdominal exercise mode, the pedals jam up to provide stability for the intended actions. The rowing action can be performed by pulling the stiff elastic handles and bands, while in the abdominal trainer mode the seat cushion is pulled with the feet to a slightly lower position. This way the user can perform the vital exercise to stay in shape.",
            "Dashboard UI design of the GYMO bike toggles based on the action performed. While commuting, the Ride mode is activated -displaying the current speed, GPS navigation interface, electric battery level, and the current weather conditions. In Exercise Mode the user sees all the workout modes, the calories burnt, and the different setups. In both of these exercise modes, the user can connect to the online community to keep motivated and move up the leaderboard.",
            "The designer has created a 1:3 model of the unique motorbike and exercise bike combo, to prove its viability in real-world settings. Whether or not it’ll speed up beyond this scale modeling stage and turn into a real prototype, and eventually into a commercial product is still uncertain."

        "segments": [
            "The results may look fascinating, but what’s cooler is that this comes from OpenAI’s DALL-E 2, founded by Elon Musk. So in a way, credit for this Apple Car goes to Tesla’s Elon Musk?! Mmm??",
            "Meet the Apple Car, from the mind of an AI. Designed by Dall-E 2 based on a text prompt from designer, educator, and YouTuber John Mauriello, this Apple Car is fascinating for two prime reasons – the car’s design itself, but more importantly, the underlying AI technology that ended up creating the car. The genesis for this idea came from Marques Brownlee’s own efforts with DALL-E 2. In a YouTube video, Brownlee demonstrated how simply typing the words “Apple Car” resulted in a car that looked like the apple fruit. This became a starting point for Mauriello, who instead, decided to tweak the prompt a little to get more specialized results. Mauriello told the AI to design a “Minimalist Sportscar inspired by a MacBook and a Magic Mouse, built out of aluminum and glass”, while also specifying it to design something in the style of Apple’s former design head, Jony Ive. The AI churned up multiple images using those text-based cues as a reference point. It correctly understood terms like ‘sportscar’, ‘MacBook’, ‘Magic Mouse’, ‘Aluminum’, and ‘Jony Ive’. To his credit, Mauriello didn’t mention the word ‘Apple’ anywhere in his prompt, given its close association with the fruit. Eventually, it grasped the essence of those terms and designed something that made sense, rather than mashing stuff together (which is what other AI diffusion engines tend to do). The car looks quite stunning to say the least, and has a sleek, curvilinear quality to it, with a machined aluminum body and zero breaks in the surface. It’s as if Jony Ive teamed up with Jaguar or Aston Martin to bring this car to life!",
            "The AI Engine works by creating variations based on the same prompt. This results in images that are connected by theme, but aren’t essentially the same, making the AI a great exploratory and ideation tool. There are some parts where the AI ends up making flaws, like the fact that the car on top has front wheels that aren’t touching the ground, or a few images later, where the car doesn’t have a windshield or even windows. Symmetry isn’t a strong suit for the AI too. Practically these may be industrial design drawbacks, but conceptually, the AI absolutely nailed the brief. If you look carefully at the image above, the AI even put an easter egg into the picture in the form of a warped Apple Watch wallpaper (or is it a HomePod animation?) on the rear of the car!",
            "This so-called Apple Car, despite its minor flaws, looks absolutely stunning. Unlike other Apple Car concepts that are either too outrageous-looking or too boring and ‘car-like’, this AI-generated sportscar is sheer perfection. It’s sleek, aerodynamic, and looks just about as luxurious as something Apple itself would put out. It also helps that the AI also used wonderful dramatic chiaroscuro-style lighting to bring out the car’s surfaces! I’m not an Apple guy but I’d buy that.",
            "An industrial design professor and YouTuber, John Mauriello has spent a significant amount of time exploring AI-based generative design tools. He’s also made an incredibly comprehensive YouTube video about Artificial Intelligence in the context of design and human creativity that’s a must-watch in my book. DALL-E 2 is currently open only to a restricted group of people, although you can sign up to join their waitlist. If anyone from OpenAI is reading this, help me out? I’ve been waiting for my invite since April!",

Well, that’s the objective of China’s premier awards program, the Design Intelligence Award. Established in 2015 by the China Academy of Art, the DIA Award doesn’t just discover good design… It develops it. Working in part as an award program and in part as a product accelerator, the DIA Award celebrates innovation and entrepreneurial imagination. The free-to-enter award program has a two-round judging and evaluation process, with the aim to help develop products that uniquely benefit humanity. In doing so, the DIA Award also aims at creating a platform to accelerate international trade, increase connectivity, and open up commercial opportunities. After all, good design is only impactful when it reaches and benefits more people, right? To that end, the award program has even set up a prize fund worth ¥5 million RMB, or $750,000 USD to help incubate great ideas into great designs.",
            "The Design Intelligence Award’s judging process occurs in two stages – a preliminary, and a more hands-on final one. During this time, an elite panel of 550 multidisciplinary design experts evaluates the entries based on three criteria/layers – 1) The fundamental layer emphasizes the “Principles of Design”, covering functionality, aesthetics, technicality, user experience, and sustainability. 2) The advanced layer emphasizes the “Direction of Design”, spanning contribution to humanity, industry, and the future. 3) The top layer emphasizes the “Impact of Design” in regard to social influence and industrial development.",
            "Based on these criteria, the DIA Jury Panel selects 30 outstanding projects that are innovative and positively impactful. Winners get access to the DIA’s prize fund of ¥5 million RMB ($750,000 USD) with the winner alone getting ¥1 million RMB. Although that isn’t the end of it. All winners are invited to the DIA Award Ceremony to engage face-to-face with global representatives from various industries such as design, academic circles, media, etc. The award also organizes a set of expert lectures known as the D-WILL, sponsored by Zhejiang Modern Intelligent Manufacturing Promotion Center and Design Innovation Center of China Academy of Art, with the intent to spearhead innovation and connectivity. With “Meet design, Meet future” as its initial intention, the Lecture invites education experts, industry elites, and pioneers to share their achievements and insights in their personal research and careers with younger generations. Finally, winners get featured in the media as a part of a coordinated PR push to help get their work noticed by everybody. In fact, you can scroll down to see a few winners and honorable mentions from last year’s Design Intelligence Awards.",

With a cockpit no larger than your average automobile, the X2 sits two people and uses four propellers for vertical take-off and landing (VTOL). Its unique aesthetic is a combination of cyberpunk inspiration along with aerodynamism. The X2 takes on a teardrop shape for peak aerodynamic efficiency, but has an aesthetic that still puts it in somewhat car territory. If you’re wondering whether the X2 is also made from a bulletproof metal alloy like the Cybertruck, it isn’t. Instead, it uses a carbon-fiber interior and exterior to achieve that lightweight build needed to be an efficient ‘flying car’!",

Carbon fiber, oddly enough, makes for a rather interesting material when it comes to acoustics. We’ve seen carbon fiber guitars and speakers in the past, although this might be the first carbon fiber violin we’ve ever laid our eyes upon. Designed with an incredibly sleek and streamlined body, this violin is a lot thinner than traditional violins, and lighter too. Designed using “injection molding methods” (although how one would do that for a hollow instrument is definitely puzzling), the violin comes with what looks like an entirely unibody design, making it much tougher than any other violin out there. It also means the violin can come in a host of different colors, bringing an entirely new appeal to the otherwise strictly traditional instrument.",

This dramatically helps scale down the laptop’s original framework, making it mildly thicker, but smaller width-wise, thanks to the folding screen. Each X1 Folf also comes with a kickstand to prop the screen up, and a stylus that lets you experience the Windows-based tablet’s full potential.",

The Sadler comes with a carbon fiber frame and a motor built into the rear hubless wheel. The bike’s minimalist design goes one step further thanks to its folding action, which makes it occupy less than half its original space. Designed in Italy, the Sadler bike weighs a nominal 15 kilograms, but can support nearly ten times its weight. The e-bike’s internal battery has a range of 90 kilometers, while the rear-wheel motor can hit speeds of up to 25 km/h, as specified by EU regulations.",

This world’s first front-wheel-drive car was produced between 1948 – 1990 with more than 3.8 million units sold. In fact, the ride mirrored the Volkswagen Beetle in more ways than not. The definite charm of both these cars is truly undeniable all these years, and still continues to brush automotive fans.",
            "To revive the nostalgic memories of this economy family car, designer Jean Louis Bui has penned an electric concept in a modern avatar. Dubbed the Citroën La 2 Deuche Concept, this cheeky mini car has a sense of airiness to it. Retro DNA of the vehicle is visible in the section over the wheels, the headlights and the accordion-like retracting rooftop which turns it into a convertible. According to Jean the styling is picked from the simple lines and silhouette of the inspiration – particularly the Charleston version. The rest of it has the more modern profiling – especially the side profile and rear. Those taillights and the wheels do give off the futuristic vibe, and as far as the exterior goes, it ends there.",
            "Designer: Jean Louis Bui",
            "The big Citroën logo on the grille makes the modern-looking version of the 2CV come alive combined with the dual colorway in shimmering black and red. The other color option the designer goes for is the sea green and black which also looks nice but I would not go for this one if ever Citroën plans to revive the classic for real. That Charleston-influenced bio-tone color is quite evident in here, and it’s refreshing. Also, this has to be a playful vehicle owing to its style and colors, just like the Citroën 2CV back in its glorious time. The designer in his submission emphasized that the concept embodies the “emblem of France as well as the Eiffel Tower, the baguette or the croissant.”"

To be precise, the Estuary Hopper is a city bus on any ordinary day, but as things turn ugly, the reliable public transport turns into a potent emergency response vehicle. The designer envisions it to bring dual mobility across the Gloucestershire floodplain. The Amphibious chassis of this cool bus adapts to the rising water levels to propel forward even on waterlogged surfaces.",

            "In the event of an emergency like a flash flood when the River Severn rages, the public transport comes on its own thanks to the amphibious chassis. The large rugged tires provide the needed traction to move forward even in the most treacherous flooding conditions. There are attachments included like the exterior pontoons that can be hooked on to the stills. This way the vehicle adds extra space to haul loads or rescue people.",
            "To take on the fury of nature, the vehicle has a central spine running along the length to support the interior blocks and the modular panels. This also permits flexible configurable setups – for example, the mid-sized bus for the usual commute and the narrower setup for movement through narrow spaces. There’s an added row of folding seats along the side to provide more space and aid in loading wheelchairs or luggage. To top it off, the Estuary Hopper bus has a very attractive form that’s way ahead of the current time. Perhaps it is designed keeping in mind the future of mobility that’ll be dominated by a fleet of multipurpose vehicles – both on land and on the waters. Let’s not forget the air too with flying cars coming on their own in the last five years or so!"

For someone with a family, this makes more sense, but for one who loves MINI for the pure fun of driving, it doesn’t hold much merit.",

The seating configuration of the front seat can be oriented in the relaxation mode as it can be maneuvered in all directions depending to need. It can even be folded down to make space for additional poufs for relaxing comfortably on the rear seats. The perfect scenario for working in a scenic landscape or socializing with buddies.

The car’s envisioned in white (as are most Polestar automobiles), and has the same headlights as the Precept. Unlike the Precept, however, the Adaptor is a slick, floor-hugging roadster with no top. And it seats just two people, who can access the car’s cabin using a rather unseen door style, but more on that later.",

A car that looks capable yet equally thrilling, inviting you for the ride. Chiu designed the Adaptor to be the kind of car that people would enjoy to drive, or even ride in. The lack of a top means feeling the wind on your hair, and the low-slung body allows you to hit higher speeds while maintaining great downforce.",
            "Chiu also speaks about how the Polestar Adaptor would gather data for its level 5 autonomy. There’s a focus on privacy, stating that all the information the car collects is owned by the owners of the car. The driver can use this to train their car’s AI while being certain that any data the Adaptor collects won’t be monetized or infringed upon.",
            "What’s perhaps the most interesting detail is the Adaptor’s cabin. The car is relatively slab-shaped and has doors that are located horizontally on the top rather than on the sides of the car. Its interiors (if you can call them that) are a modern take on the sidecar, with an elongated cockpit for the driver, and a more enclosed cabin for the shotgun rider. When observed from the top, the cabin looks almost ‘star-shaped’, like a reinterpretation of Polestar’s own logo. The elongated cabin for the driver comes with a steering wheel, and should they choose, will also support level 5 autonomy so the driver and passenger can both enjoy the thrill of the journey!"

This sim racing wheel is ideated keeping in mind the needs of the most avid racing simulator fanatics who want everything to be perfect. TRZ-Y is for gamers who are pinned down from having a good experience due to the lack of available space for a full-fledged racing simulator setup. It is meant to be used without a dedicated pedal setup, thereby saving even more space on your desk.",

The concept racing wheel is also meant to be a plug-and-play input for concept hypercars, thanks to the future-forward design language. Force feedback on this one comes courtesy of the high-performance responsive motor located on the rear, and the customizable controls give the user a plethora of options when being used.",
            "Since a racing wheel is going to be used for extended hours of gameplay, the designer incorporates ergonomic grip and tactile feedback from the paddles for an immersive gaming experience. This also ensures able hand and arm support for long hours of gaming fun. The customizable controls on both front sides of the racing wheel can be set up for elements like the real-time map view of the lap, the currently selected gear, or the RPMs. They can also be toggled for physical buttons just like on circuit racing cars.",

Designed presumably for the Cybertruck (given that it’s more purpose-built for the outdoors), the trailer also comes with a SpaceX Starlink internet terminal, helping extend internet connectivity along with your Tesla’s overall range capacity.",
            "Designer: Tesla",
            "These images come from Twitter user Tesla Adri, who broke the story of sorts, given that it occurred at a lesser-known expo in Germany. There’s no official name to this contraption, although calling it the Tesla Solar Range Extending Trailer seems to encompass exactly what the device does. Looking at just the image above, it’s pretty clear that this automotive accessory is straight-up massive. It’s sized like a pretty large trailer, and the kind you’d feel more comfortable hooking to the back of a Cybertruck rather than a slim, lean Model 3. The trailer sports a set of fold-out panels solar panels that charge a massive battery pack below it. This can, in turn, be used as a supplementary power source for your EV, extending its overall range. Visitors were also quick to note that the trailer also had a built-in SpaceX Starlink satellite internet receiver, giving you a seamless internet connection no matter where you are on the globe. Sounds like the ultimate off-road camping accessory if you ask me. Or something a prepper would buy.",
            "“It’s not clear why Tesla built the trailer and unveiled it at the show, but the automaker is not expected to sell it to the public any time soon. If those are all 300W panels (and they look a little small for that), then the optimum output would be 2.7kW. That means it would generate less than 50 miles of range a day extended or a third of that folded up”, reported Electrek in their coverage. It’s presumed that this prototype was designed more of an easter egg designed to attract visitors, rather than actually project the company’s intent. However, only time will tell. I’m still waiting on the Roadster that Elon announced almost 5 years ago…",

            "Self-driving cars were, at one point, the obsession of the automotive industry. To some extent, the drive is still there, but the hype has died down a bit as manufacturers, developers, and designers try to reevaluate their priorities and objectives. Admittedly, many of the newer car concepts that appeared in the past two years would only make sense if the cars could drive themselves, but the focus is less on the technology or the commuting experience and more on well-being and sustainability. The latter is particularly lacking in many visions of the future, where the technologies and luxuries of these cars would translate to even higher carbon emissions and waste. One concept, however, tries to go the metaphorical extra mile to envision a car that is sustainable, satisfying, and also social.",
            "Designer: Asahi Kasei",
            "Many future car concepts naturally put the convenience and comfort of passengers at the forefront. After all, why would you even bother with having a car drive itself if not for the safety, pleasure, and well-being of the people inside? As with many hi-tech visions, previous concepts didn’t pay particular mind to the impact these vehicles would have on the environment. They might run on green energy, but the materials and resources used to build these cars might still be harmful to the environment.",
            "AKXY2, short for “Asahi Kasei x You 2,” is a future mobility concept that makes sustainability one of the three core pillars of its design. In addition to running on electricity rather than fuel, its interior is designed using materials that are made from recycled PET bottles, other wastes, or plant-derived substances. Asahi Kasei already has such a floor mat made from plant-derived materials and is touted to be better than PET fibers. Even the surface coating, which has the severest impact on the environment, will switch to using something more sustainable and environment-friendly.",
            "Of course, the AKXY2 concept isn’t just all about sustainability. Inside and out, the car concept embodies the new priorities that the pandemic has caused throughout the world. Sanitation and anti-microbial materials have become a key feature in many new products, and this car will have them on many of its surfaces. People have also realized the importance of social connections, even if just being able to see other people out in the world. So rather than enclose passengers in an opaque capsule, the AKXY2 employs a transparent dome that lets people easily see the world and people outside.",
            "In fact, the AKXY2’s design is closer to a boat than a car, with a “bubble” that exposes riders to the outside world while still keeping them safe inside that zone. The car’s cabin design, as well as the way it opens up, is almost akin to a trailer with a picnic setup. Rather than a vehicle that is simply used to transport people and keep isolated groups within their own islands, Asahi Kasei envisions a future where cars connect people not only to each other but also to the world they live in."

            "Our highways are getting congested, and there is almost no easy solution to that, especially with the growing number of vehicles on the road. The most common quick-fix is to build more highways, though some are attempting to dig up new ground as well. There are also plans to build super-fast trains (some that also tunnel underground), but that only works if you happen to be going somewhere near a train station. They say that the shortest path from point A to point B is a straight line, but you can only really travel that path if you’re flying overhead over all obstacles. Naturally, that’s a utopian dream of many inventors and commuters, one that might be close to reality as far as one Swedish company is concerned.",
            "Designer/Inventor: Tomasz Patan (Jetson)",
            "Flying cars have been in works of science fiction for decades. The idea of flying freely in the skies, without having to share seats with dozens of strangers, has appealed to the imagination ever since man first dreamed of flying. In recent times, however, that dream has almost become a future necessity if the problem of traffic congestion and personal travel is to be ever solved.",
            "The Jetson ONE is one (no pun intended) of those solutions currently in active development, and it may have just taken one step closer to making that dream come true. Company co-founder and inventor Tomasz Patan took a working prototype for a spin and commuted from home to work as if flying on a racecar turned helicopter was the most normal thing in the world. The company hasn’t released exact details yet, other than the regular commute time was slashed by as much as 88% while delivering Patan safely to his destination.",
            "The vehicle is just the latest in the growing number of eVTOLs or electric Vertical Take-Off and Landing aircrafts being developed for personal use. Unlike a private jet and more like a helicopter, an eVTOL like the Jetson ONE takes off and lands vertically (hence the name), which saves up on having to put a runaway anywhere a flying car has to fly or land. And similar to a Tesla, many eVTOLs are designed to run on electricity rather than fuel to avoid one of the biggest sins of automobiles.",
            "The Jetson ONE and others like it try to cut the time and hassle of commuting, but most of them work for only one person or at most two passengers. This raises concerns about the legality of driving (or flying) such vehicles, whether you’d need to be a licensed pilot to even use one. Of course, by that time, there might be new tests and certifications in place similar to driving land-bound vehicles.",
            "These flying cars, however, might also introduce a new kind of traffic congestion given their very personal nature and design. Unlike a sedan, you can’t exactly “eVTOLpool” rides, which means there will be dozens, if not hundreds, of these flying cars zooming in the air in that future scenario. It might also mean a lot of manufacturing waste, just like what we have with regular cars, turning the idyllic dream into a sustainability nightmare. Fortunately, we’re still far from reaching that point, despite the success of this test flight, but it’s about time we prepare for the inevitable rather than being caught unaware like with self-driving cars."

The two-level cargo sections on the Streek can be tweaked for big or small cargo, and with options like panniers, it brings hassle-free hauling into the equation. This gives the commuter a very compact footprint which is crucial in high-traffic locations. There’s a gaping open space in the middle thanks to the open-frame design which can be used for storage. Envision is also working on accessories that can be mounted onto the frame for even more options.",
            "Talking of the important specifications for potential buyers, the trike measures 74.4-inches long x 23 inches wide, and weighs just 32 kg in an unloaded configuration. The front 18-inch wheels get independent tilting suspensions for a smooth ride. Streek has a 374-Wh battery mounted to the steering tube which provides 250-W pedal-assist electric mid-drive (Nidec electric drive) to carry along loads of up to 132 lb at a top speed of 15 mph.",
            "According to the company, the electric trike has a range of 75 miles in eco mode and 31 miles in power mode. Keep in mind though, that the more weight the rider carries, the numbers will definitely go down as far as range is concerned. Streek T5 is agonizingly close to hitting the production lines as it was earlier supposed to be up for pre-order this spring, but for the pandemic-induced delays. That could happen by the end of this year or early 2023. The cool little trike will carry an estimated price tag of around $3,000."

The designer has kept the widebody stance of this Volvo very upfront, suggesting its dominating road presence.",
            "Those aerodynamic sidepods and the intimidating presence of the Volvo EV hint at its powerful drivetrain to match the looks. While it’s not clear whether the ride is a four-seater or a bolder two-seater coupe, either way, it seems laden in comfort, luxury and user-centric technology on the inside. The side cut-out for the single doors on either side suggests I take a bet on a two-seater configuration.",
            "Overall Volvo’s blueprint has a balanced feel to it, and all likely to attract automotive design pros in-house as well as from other renowned vehicle manufacturers. Oh yes, not to forget the budding automotive designers who’ll be eying this cool design for their own concept inspirations."

            "The motivation to build this uber-exclusive longtail version inspired by the 1960s Le Mans speed machines and aircraft design came after two of their clients (also passionate Huayra fans) approached Pagani about this idea. Working in tandem, Pagani Grandi Complicazioni (Pagani special projects division) and the two fans finalized the concept design over a period of two years. The company then created a one-quarter and a 1:1 scale model of the car, before hitting the production lines to craft just five of the Huayra Codalunga which have already been sold. With the global regulation compliances and the amount of R&D put into the making, the mind-numbing price tag of 7 million euros (approximately $7.37 million) doesn’t pop out eyes at all.",

Codalunga is a rear-wheel-drive mated to a 7-speed sequential transmission. The silver lining is its dry weight of 2,822 pounds which is around 154 pounds less than the Huayra. So, I can safely bet it will match (or even better) the acceleration of 0-60 mph in under 3.0 seconds and a top speed of 220 mph, given its Huayra DNA. The shedding of pounds is attributed to the ditched rear grilles and adding a titanium exhaust that weighs only 9.7 pounds. To a motorhead’s delight, the car’s exposed exhaust system means more sex appeal, if I can put it mildly.",

The carbon-ceramic brakes provide superior stopping power for demanding buyers. As a throwback to the racers of the 60s, the Codalunga comes in semi-matte and matte colors.

            "Inspired by the BMW bikes of the 30s and 40s, Andrea Radaelli of Radikal Chopper got to work on this beauty the old-fashioned way. His idea first started out as a paper sketch and then progressed to prototyping entirely by hand. This BMW R 18 custom build is made entirely from hand-machined and finished aluminum, with a handmade wooden seat to match… and that aesthetic? That 1930s art-deco steampunk-ish vibe isn’t an accident – Radaelli toon inspiration from the BMW R37, giving an ornate Ghostrider-meets-Mad-Max spin to his design, before promptly (and rather aptly) naming it the Magnifica.",
            "Designer: Andrea Radaelli (Radikal Chopper)",
            "Radaelli’s Magnifica is truly a celebration of human imagination. With no CAD or render as a starting point, Radaelli was forced to quickly pen his vision down in sketch form, creating a series of 2D reference points that would then be translated directly to the prototype. Nothing on the R 18 Magnifica is bought, everything (or almost everything) has been thought out and built by hand… with the exception of the bike’s rims, which were made with numerically controlled machines working on a design that Radaelli himself had developed. “Even the innovative brake discs and calipers were specially created”, BMW observes in their press release.",
            "Beneath the retro aesthetics lies a technologically modern motorbike, lightened by around 100 kg: the weight of the BMW R 18 Magnifica is in fact around 250-260 kg, compared with 345 kg for the original model.",
            "“The bike has to be my own creation,”, Radaelli said. “I don’t feel like dredging up or modifying a concept already set up and done very well by others.” The inspiration for the design of the BMW R 18 Magnifica pays a hat tip to the vintage motorbikes of the 1920s, 30s, and 40s, given that they “have an incredible charm that even today many modern motorbikes cannot replicate”.",
            "The task at hand for Radaelli was no easy feat. As old school as the bike was, so was its design process. Radaelli started off by sketching on paper, before directly building out his vision on a naked R 18, using materials like aluminum, brass, and mahogany wood with a few stainless steel accents here and there. The entire motorcycle’s aesthetic is unforgettable at best, with complex details and parts that come together to magically make the entire motorcycle. The motorbike boasts of an almost entirely redesigned outer body, with a custom fuel tank, boxer engine clad, and even dashboard. The forks have the same slope as the original ones but a look reminiscent of those on vintage motorbikes, inside, however, they are completely modern, built from billet parts. The electrical system has not been modified; everything is fully functional. The dimensions, rims, and tires have remained true to the original: the bike is perfectly serviceable.",
            "The rear of the bike is designed to look as if it’s hovering above the surface. With a slick, aerodynamic form (although I’m not too sure how comfortable it is for the pillion rider), the Magnifica’s seat is hand-carved from mahogany, with a stainless steel accent running down the center, acting as a continuation of the bike’s overall obsession with polished metal. It’s an obsession that I personally enjoy. For Radaelli, the end result was supposed to be ‘jewel-like’, and it absolutely is. Just like a shimmering diamond with multiple facets, the Magnifica too has multiple curved surfaces that reflect light in uniquely pleasant ways (one could argue that the Cybertruck’s flat-ish design does the opposite, hence its polarizing appeal).",
            "Commissioned by Officine Riunite Milanesi, and unveiled at the Top Marques show in Monaco, the Magnifica joins an impressive roster of BMW-backed customs based on the R 18."

However, when the user presses a button, the Wheel X enters into its “Sport” state, and it will automatically rotate the grip to transform from an “O” shape to a “W” shape. Upon entering the Sport mode, the texture on the wheel/yoke gets enhanced too, providing a much better grip while controlling and steering your car.",
            "Another interesting aspect about the Wheel X is its dynamic dashboard, which goes from a flat backlit display to a more analog one. While the flat display is more data drive, providing information like navigation along with speed, the analog display is much more traditional, with a speedometer, oil gauge, and fuel gauge.",
            "What the Wheel X does is unique, giving drivers a choice when it comes to the kind of control interface they want while driving.  Designer Zijie Liu also mentions that the Wheel X could easily support unmanned driving, with the flat dashboard providing commute-related information.",

        "segments": [
            "The reason the Harley-Davidson Street Fighter concept looks nothing like your average motorbike is that it wasn’t designed keeping one in mind. Created, instead, with the template of a car, the motorbike concept’s body comes with a more square-ish cross-section, defined edge lines, and a fully faired bulky-yet aerodynamic shape that can generally be attributed to automobile design. You’ve got to admit, it does look interesting… but more importantly, it unlocks a new design direction for motorbikes in general.",
            "Designer: Yan-Xuan Lai",
            "The Street Fighter’s streamlined shape starts with its headlight, which takes a continuous curve right into the fuel tank in what I can only describe as a TRON Light Cycle or Dodge Tomahawk-inspired direction. This does an important thing in giving the Street Fighter a strong silhouette, making it immediately recognizable. Speaking of being unusual but recognizable, the concept also sports a minimalist version of the Harley-Davidson logo on the side. Everything about the Street Fighter challenges notions without straying too far away from tradition.",
            "The Harley-Davidson concept takes on a hybrid engine approach, making it potentially the first hybrid Harley. It comes with your traditional fuel tank, but also sports a battery right under it. Although this is just a concept, the thought of having a flammable battery right below the fuel tank does quite bother me. In fact, it’s probably the only thing I’d immediately change about this motorbike.",
            "The riding position is closer to a racing bike, allowing riders to ride more freely on the race track or mountain roads. While Harley-Davidsons have a reputation for being suburban or highway creatures, the Street Fighter, as its name suggests, prefers any sort of road – even a racetrack.",
            "The rest of the bike is a combination of old and new car-design sensibilities. Of course, the curved tire covers and the rather traditional-looking leather seat give it an old-world charm, but the rest of the bike is quite certainly modern and out-of-the-box. The fuel tank has sculpted details that feel very ‘car-like’, the bike’s full-fairing body feels rather automotive-inspired too, and the dashboard, which pops right out of the bike’s continuous upper curve, is decidedly minimalist.",
            "The Harley-Davidson Street Fighter comes from the mind of Taiwanese designer Yan-Xuan Lai, who uses the term “elegant and fierce” to describe his creation. For Lai, his prime objective was to try and combine the “features of the classic streamlined car shape with the strong vision of sports street bikes” to create a radical new aesthetic. Personally, it works purely on a visual level, although aerodynamic considerations need to be made if Lai really envisions this concept to be a racing bike.",
            "That being said, it isn’t far-fetched to think of an electrified Harley. The company did announce the LiveWire in 2014, their first electric endeavor. The LiveWire series ended up being spun off into a separate company in 2021, so even though Harley-Davidson is pretty traditional with their motorcycle designs, their sister-company could certainly push out a hybrid beast like the Street Fighter!"

            "As we head into the future, safeguarding the environment and all its resources will be vital for the health of the planet earth. Making optimum utilization of available natural resources will be paramount as we march into a mindful and conscious lifestyle. Some examples already making this future possible include aquaculture, off-shore wind farming, and conventional forms of harnessing gifts of nature without leaving behind a damaging carbon footprint.",
            "On the same lines, Cerberus Algae cultivation concept by Bernhard Büttner of HTW Berlin is a good example of truly sustainable water management. There’s no denying that sustainable development is gaining momentum as people become aware of the undeniable benefits. This concept of optimizing and harvesting ecological resources autonomously is substantially weighing. On the roots, the concept is a great solution that’s part economical and part environmentally feasible.",
            "Designers: Arthur Worbes, Ony Yan and Bernhard Büttner",
            "The ultra-modern vessel is shaped like a catamaran to make the drifting on waters easy. As it glides on the water surface, the connected rig with the harvesting system extracts algae and filters the contents. The collection pods anchored to the seabed nearby then process the contents for the subsequent usage.",
            "The concept presses for truly sustainable agriculture – or to be more precise – aquaculture! The various kinds of algae species floating on the surface of the water and underneath it are a great resource for food, medical technologies, biofuels, clothing industry, and 3D prototyping. Initially, the Cerberus is going to be a semi-autonomous system, but eventually, with its advanced AI, it’ll graduate to a fully autonomous idea. The concept has great potential for a sustainable working cycle as it provides the raw material for various eco-friendly industries sans any water pollution or depleting aquatic life."

            "Lancia has had its share of highs and then unfortunate lows as it didn’t manage to strike the right notes with the more modern auto lovers. Thankfully, they are making a comeback in 2024 in collaboration with Alfa Romeo and DS – a piece of heartening news for Lancia fans on the 115th anniversary last year.",
            "What the jointly collaborated brand will offer is still in question, but I hope it is a sports coupe or a striking roadster that’ll turn the tables for the Italian automotive legend. Laszlo Varga’s Lancia Vision Alpha concept adds excitement to this already good news – a sports car with the brand’s DNA with the right blend of modern aesthetics. I’m sure design experts at Lancia will be watching this in incognito mode already to derive some inspiration.",
            "Designer: Laszlo Varga",
            "While we all have a fair idea already about where they are heading – electric obviously – clean energy-powered performance cars will have many takers. It’s like jumping onto the EV future without forgetting the roots of the company. The Vision Alpha’s front end has slim LED headlights and the horizontal vents (it could hint at an internal combustion-powered drivetrain) remind me of the original Stratos in more ways than not. The angular design of the Stratos has been subdued to a fair extent with the rounded edges for a more contoured aesthetics.",
            "The designer has put a lot of work into designing the concept from scratch, and the level of detail is impressive. This sports car gives off that tell-tale redemption vibe – challenging other futuristic cars to up their game before any imminent launches in the next couple of years or so. Back to reality though, Lancia could play it safe and release more consumer-oriented models to initially capture the interest and then later on go to release such luxury models once the waters calm down."

            "People are embracing tiny lifestyle far quicker and more aggressively than ever before. This movement has picked up pace especially during the pandemic when remote working has become a new normal. People are now investing in campers and tiny homes to lead a city-esque, comfortable life in remote locations. To cater to this generation of urban nomads, a designer has conceived Volvo, The Local Project.",
            "Well, the name basically gives out a clear idea of the project being linked to automotive giant Volvo. Perhaps, the involvement is not limited to name, the designer has even drawn cues from the Swedish manufacturer to realize the interiors and optimally use the limited space available. Thriving on Volvo’s design language is one aspect, the Local Project is conceived with the vision to create a balanced lifestyle of urban and rural life. So, the contraption is packed and tailored with posh amenities to ensure residents don’t feel the change from their luxury homes and can settle in the Local Project irrespective of where it is stationed.",
            "Designer: Oscar Holm Wastesson",
            "The project’s divided into two elements: A light edition camper van (ideally a Volvo at the base), and a shared cabin network meant to be set up at various different locations. The idea of this compilation is simple. To allow and user to explore and understand the quality of life of wherever the journey leads to. Even though the Local Project camper van does not foray into the rugged domain of reinforced Mercedes off-road camper nor do the cabins display stripped down ergonomics of this all-back mini home; these are designed in the league of their own where things start at the exquisite wooden interiors and lead to a uniformity of lodging, ensuring – at no point in the journey – you are devoid of the city lifestyle.",
            "To that accord, the camper has an immaculately laid out form factor with a seat for the couple in a cockpit and a luxurious double bed at the back that can conveniently flip to create an office space. This is a single room on wheels – “embodying the Volvo mission of freedom to move” – but ties the occupants to city dwelling even through their transit from home to a Local Project cabin in the countryside. At the pre-set cabin, users are aware to expect the obvious luxuries, unlike the surprises in countryside vacation rentals. With this approach to tourism, Volvo, The Local Project ensures the residents can explore the locale with utmost curiosity, least niggles and complaints about logging in the home away from home."

            "What if you could ride to work on a bike and disassemble it at the destination to reassemble it as an armchair to sit on in the meeting room? It is not easy for industrial designers to create a product disguised as a completely different idea. This is how the Outlaw Bike was born in Brazil though. We can argue, and you will read further why, that the bike is designed as an awareness campaign against the Brazilian tax regime, but it is in fact a project that will have many minds latching onto the idea for industrial gains.",
            "Leaving that for the creative heads and ones with dosh to burn; we’ll get on with the idea at hand. The bicycle, a design by Cardoso Cycles for a collaborative awareness drive by Talent Marcel and Bicycling Magazine, can be disassembled instantly to be assembled into an armchair and a table. The idea is to draw the Brazilian tax authority’s attention to the tax burden that affects sales of bicycles in the country.",
            "Designer: Denis Cardoso",
            "In general, bikes are more common around the world in comparison to cars. People use bikes for health and to stay in shape in some countries, while in nations like Netherlands and Germany bikes are mostly used for transportation. The popularity of bikes is steadily scaling in Brazil but taxes as high as 70 percent on bicycles makes bikes very expensive and render them inaccessible to most of the population. The Outlaw Bike however pretends to be furniture (which is taxable at 12 percent) so it is less expensive.",
            "The project allows consumers to choose the form factor of their product: furniture or bicycle; depending on the tax option they choose. That said, either way, the furniture or bike are made from the same parts and same material. It’s only that they are assembled differently. The materials involved include treated wood, laminates, aluminum, steel and environmentally-friendly leather. The bike handle and frame are made of wood while the saddle is leather coated. The other parts are made from aluminum. When used as an armchair, the wood becomes the frame and leather spreads out for the seat. The metal body forms the base of the table topped with the cycle wheel.",
            "The Outlaw bike; Denis Cardoso, owner of Cardoso Cycles notes, is only a prototype designed to highlight the high tax burdens. It is not for sale, though he does not rule out the possibility of the bike-furniture combo being commercialized in the future. If it is sold, it would be “valued around 3,800 reais” (approx. $800) if taxed as furniture, Cardoso informs. As a bicycle, it would value 58 percent more. For a marketable version, the designers will have to streamline assembly and disassembly and work on reducing the weight of the prototype."

Shanghai-based Pantuo Aviation is yet another bunch of aviation and electric vehicle professionals eyeing the early piece of the pie with thier sustainable human mobility design. The company’s goal is to develop secure, AI-enabled eVTOL passenger aircraft that ease us all into the future of mobility.",
            "The autonomous Pantala Concept H electric VTOL passenger aircraft is capable of ferrying five people from one destination to the other at cruising speeds of 300 km/h. The flying machine has an estimated range of 250 km which falls right in the alley of practical eVTOLs proposed for the end of this decade. The futuristic ride has candard tilt wings – each one of them having large diameter ducted fans with foreplane.",
            "Designer: Pantuo",
            "The front wings have four ducted fans while the rear wing gets seven. So, there are 20 ducted fans in total and 22 electric motors to propel the whole thing forward at impressive speeds. Safety is at the forefront here with the multi-redundant core integrated avionics and power systems at work. The ducted fans will considerably reduce the noise and maintenance costs which is another huge advantage.",
            "The Interior of the Concept H eVTOL is spacious and luxurious – something that can be compared to current-day luxury cars or airliners. The pilot will take command from a single front seat, accompanied by two rows of seats for the four passengers in the back. Focus on the interiors is on user-friendly interface and comfort for demanding customers. The concept resembles the seven-seater Lilium eVTOL flying Taxi having the ducted fans – slated for a 2024 release.",

The popularity of the DMC-12 multiplied three folds once it appeared in the Back to the Future movie in 1985, and to date, this iconic four-wheeler captures automotive lovers’ imagination. The original DeLorean Motor Company (DMC) was established in 1975 but somehow got bankrupt in 1982. The new avatar of the company was unearthed in 1995 and provided parts inventory, and has ever since, worked as a restoration company for the proud owners.",

The current DeLorean company has collaborated with Italdesign (the design firm that originally crafted the DMC-12) to create the electric Alpha5 with similar-looking gull-winged doors and louvered rear glass windows.",

Taking a leap ahead in size from its predecessor, the much-anticipated EV measures 4,995 millimeters long, 2,044mm wide, and 1,370mm tall. Believe it as a mere coincidence or some inspiration, the official version released here bears some of the design cues from the DeLorean concept design by Ángel Guerra which was created way back in late 2020.",
            "Alpha5 gets massive wheels, slim lights on the front and rear, and a contoured shape. The charging port is positioned on the driver’s side front fender for easy charging at stations. That nostalgic two-tone finish and the sweeping roofline as seen in the Back to the Future trilogy are heart-warming to see once again. As with other modern EV’s, this one gets a centrally positioned touchscreen, a wide digital instrument cluster, and a flat-bottomed steering wheel.",
            "Talking of the technical specifications, the Alpha5 – which will be the base performance model for now – gets a 100 kWh battery pack with an estimated range of 300 miles. The ride will go from 0-60 mph in flat 2.99 seconds and 0 to 88 mph – 2023 Tesla Roadster better be on its heels. This suggests, that better models are well on the cards in the future – a V8-powered sports coupe, electric sedan and hydrogen-powered SUV – all anticipated in the mix of things for the brand. The electric coupe has a very low drag coefficient of 0.23 which is close to that of the Mercedes EQS liftback.",

            "The Oneiric isn’t your usual yacht. Developed in partnership with Italian shipyard Rossinavi, the yacht sports a uniquely organic form on the inside and the out. Inspired by the shape of waves, Zaha Hadid Architects hopes that its design will blur the boundaries between the yacht and its surroundings, sort of like luxurious camouflage, if you will. It is set to be presented next week during Milan design week.",
            "Designers: Zaha Hadid Architects and Rossinavi",
            "The Oneiric is a 42-meter-long yacht (or a catamaran to be precise) with a twin-hull design that gives it a broader footprint. Its organic, fluid design falls well within the identity of the design language Zaha Hadid Architects is known for. The main deck features a saloon containing a bar and integrated sofas that open onto a second deck with an inbuilt hot tub and two sets of steps that lead down into the sea.",
            "The catamaran runs on a hybrid power system, relying on a combination of solar as well as fuel power with the ability to switch to 100% solar energy too. Described by Rossinavi as its “green-technology flagship”, the yacht would be covered in solar panels on three levels that would fully power it on day trips. “On a day trip, Oneiric can cruise up to 100% of the time in full-electric mode with zero emissions,” mentions Zaha Hadid Architects. “On transatlantic crossings, the yacht can cruise in full-electric mode up to 70% of the time, saving approximately 40 tonnes of CO2 compared to a conventional vessel.” The solar panels continually charge the yacht’s battery pack even when not in use, and can then in turn be used to provide power to a villa on land when the yacht’s moored.",
            "The Oneiric’s multihulls are also more energy-efficient than a conventional monohull yacht, due to their weight distribution and the hulls’ length-to-width ratio which provides greater hydrodynamic efficiency.",
            "The yacht’s interiors mirror the same design language as the exterior, with the liberal use of curved lines to balance out the rigidity of straight lines and flat surfaces, giving the overall yacht a soft appeal. “The sinuous lines and reflective surfaces of the yacht’s exterior are continued throughout the interior, blurring the boundaries between vessel and sea,” the architects said. The use of wood proves to be a rather clever choice on the architects’ part, as the wood grain further lends a ripple-like fluidity to the exterior deck as well as the interior.",
            "“The serenity on board is visual as well as auditory,” said the team at Zaha Hadid Architects. “Oneiric’s full-electric mode is capable of silent operations. In addition, the yacht benefits from the effects of Rossinavi Zero Noise technology that isolates all noise on board from the original source.”",
            "Oneiric can accommodate up to 8 guests at a time (with an additional 6 crew members), with 4 cabins for the guests, 3 for the crew, and one dedicated owner’s suite that comes wrapped in a curved glass window to give 180-degree views of the sea, and a skylight that allows light to filter from above. Multiple interior and outdoor lounging and dining areas, as well as media room with entertainment technologies, are integrated into the design together with a large owner’s suite and four guest cabins. The yacht’s interior spaces interconnect, a feature that makes the design unique. The owner’s suite provides access to the forward outdoor lounge area, which can be shaded by retractable structures."

The riding position is going to be more leaned forward courtesy of its racing characteristics, and for once a concept bike has a super comfortable saddle seat.",

The hydraulic forks connected to the humungous front wheel rim are something you’ll keep staring at without ever getting enough of it. Equally impressive and robust are the rear swingarm and the meticulously crafted exhausts. Headlights and the taillights have an ultra-boxy look which adds to the defiant persona of the concept bike.",

            "We are slowly heading into a future where sustainable and responsible farming will be vital. Avenues of farming balance crucially on the biodiversity, and regenerative ranches. Keeping multi-crop fields requires avid supervision and the CAKE Kibb autonomous mobility solution aids in regenerative agriculture in already depleting soil resources.",
            "The all-terrain ATV is designed with a priority on using natural resources wherever possible and has environmental protection etched in its DNA since it can plant and harvest crops responsibly on its own or in semi-autonomous mode. Traditionally, the machinery used on fields and farms is driven by fossil fuels which juxtaposes with the vision of taking care of the animals and surroundings without affecting the ecology of the area. This has prompted the designer to create Kibb which doesn’t impact the biodiversity of the region or damage the surroundings – rather it aids the farmers like never before.",
            "Designer: Fanny Jonsson",
            "Kibb in itself means, Ox in Gutniska dialect of the Swedish island Gotland. This is a representation of the strength of the vehicle while having the gentleness of the animal when it comes to nature. Driven by an electric motor, the ATV moves tenderly around the farm, and that too autonomously. Modularity is one key feature of Kibb, as the components can be swapped around to cater to the tasks required at the ranch or farm. This prevents obsolescence cycles as the parts can be updated over time.",
            "The powerful vehicle is designed in a way to have the least possible impact without compromising the inherent capability. A holistic approach of ATV is centered on the material choices for the components. For instance, the tires are crafted from dandelions which are in plenty in the Scandinavian landscape, or the plastic used in the body is made from locally available linseed plants grown in Sweden. The frame and other vital components are made from aluminum which is a sustainable material as compared to other industrial materials – it is highly recyclable without any major material degradation.",
            "According to the designer, the main beneficiaries of this project are the animals and the bugs living in the soil. The diverse ecosystem of all the organisms helps rejuvenate the soil’s quality over time. The electric-driven Kibb plays a vital role in this as it keeps the environment around the farm and animals untouched from any physical or chemical interference."

Modeled/sketched on Gravity Sketch before rendering in Cinema4D and adding finishing touches on Photoshop, the LMXX2 comes alive as a beast of the sands, leaving a trail of dust and sore losers behind it. The LMXX2 amps up Lamborghini’s already angular design, and ditches regular wheels for something even more edgy and badass. Treads run around the edge of the car, covering the base and the upper edges of the windows, creating a dynamic side profile that actually requires you to enter and exit the car through its treads. The treads aren’t your average ones either – they come with flaps that dig into the soil, propelling you forward. When out of the soil, the treads look almost like scales, giving the LMXX2 the appearance of a reptile ready to attack!"

There’s a very animated character to it, but mind you this is how the EV is going to look when it finally rolls on the tarmac. Those triangulated projector lamps (resembling the Mercedes Benz star logo), matte black glasses, and the elongated tail which add to the dynamic appeal. Everything right from the long wheelbase to the contrasting short overhangs or the low-slung body – give it a domineer way above its punching weight (if that’s not too judgmental).",

If we move on to the front section, the Vision AMG has a Panamericana grille with vertical slats. As we move to the rear, the tapered roof embodies into the teardrop shape at the rear end. Those illuminations on the tip encapsulate the body flank running smoothly to the rear wheel well. The tail has three brake lamps on either side, and the three-dimensional design of the lights can be mistaken for exhaust pipes, but actually, they aren’t.",

When needed the one on top can be rotated horizontally to reveal the underlying set of headlights for times when it is difficult to see the road up ahead. Of course, there are the modernized fog lights above the windshield, but hey, extra lights are always a perk. While the riders won’t have to stress their eyes while driving in inhospitable weather conditions, those big headlights could create a blindspot.",

Bulli Transporter, Kombi or Microbus) burst into the scene in 1950, and by 1960 it soared in popularity during the counterculture movement. Mechanically it was similar to the Type 1 Beetle but almost half less capable in power. Also known as the T1, the van was undoubtedly a great success for Volkswagen.",
            "This one originally started its life as a standard 1962 Splitty before morphing into a Half-track Fox in 1962. Before changing a couple of hands landed in the workshop of Austrian mechanic Kurt Kretzner who further turned it into a snow riding mean machine like none other. That’s because he was not too impressed with the off-roading capabilities of the van since he had to frequently climb the Alps in inclement weather conditions.",
            "Designer: ic Kurt Kretzner and Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles",
            "He started off by adding two more axles to the chassis and then adding 13-inch wheels driving the chain-driven tracks which he designed on his own. The steering bit of the vehicle is left to the original front axles with the 14-inch off-road tires. As the van has to be driven on steep snow-laden tracks, Kurt mindfully added limited-slip differential to the equation as well. All this makes sure the rear tracks have better traction and move in the desired direction without any slipping or sliding.",
            "The crawling machine goes at a top speed of 35 kph (a tad slower than the Red Fox at 48 kph) powered by the 1.2-liter flat-four engine producing 34 horsepower. According to Kurt, this modification makes the VW Type 2 go easy on any terrain be it snow, sand, rocky surfaces, small streams, or anything crazy imaginable. He adds by jotting down the professionals who would benefit from this machine including, “mountain hut keepers, hunters, foresters, doctors, maintenance engineers for ski-lifts, TV and radio masts, pipelines and the like.”",
            "It took the man almost four years to build his dream machine for the inhospitable snowy terrain. After going under the scanner for two decades, the vehicle was acquired by the Porsche Museum in Gmünd, Austria, in the early 90s. Thereafter it trickled down to Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles in 2018, and they did all the restoration work on the vehicle as seen now. The mechanical components were repaired and the VCV division draped the vehicle in matte orange matching the original’s hue. The interiors have also been redone in simple beech and pine wood finish."

You see, unless people own the e-scooters, chances are that managing them is a headache. Publicly available scooter-on-rent programs are problematic because mass-charging scooters is difficult. Not to mention the fact that people often treat the scooters like trash, driving them rashly, abandoning them at random places when the ride ends, and even vandalizing them. For Weißbach, UNIMO started as a way to effectively manage e-scooters. It gradually blossomed into a more comprehensive travel system.",
            "So what’s UNIMO? Well, it’s essentially a bus-like service that can expand or contract based on demand and footfall. To reach your nearest UNIMO, you need to use an e-scooter that’s essentially designed to be your last-mile vehicle. Once you drive from point A to the UNIMO’s pickup point, the e-scooter docks right into the UNIMO’s front or back, and the large EV collects and charges all the e-scooters together while in transit. Reached your stop? Plug out an e-scooter and drive it to your destination. For the most part, UNIMO collects and charges the E-scooters, while taking care of transporting the passengers so they don’t drive the scooters over longer distances, resulting in wear and tear.",
            "The UNIMO has a pretty nifty design itself. It comes with a front and an end, with carriages fitting in between like the ones you’d see on a train. These carriages come with panoramic glass canopies that are open on one side for boarding and deboarding, and seats on the inside feel as familiar as the ones on a bus.",
            "The EV runs on an electric platform, allowing the UNIMO to have that transparent canopy that provides that stellar view of the city. However, ditch the canopy and add a couple of protective netting panels and the UNIMO becomes a self-driving freight container, traversing autonomously around warehouses and shipyards.

With the gradual shift to electric motorcycles, the definitive sound of the motorcycle engines has been lost since the electric motors produce very little or no perceivable sound at all. This can be a major put-off for motorheads who are fueled by the sweet sound of fuel-powered engines. Automotive designer Lin Yu Cheng however wants to fix this with this jaw-dropping electric motorcycle design.",

As the wind blows, melodic sound is produced, and that’s what motivated him to design a bike with a resonating structure on one side. Looking more like the humongous exhausts of a hyperbike, these metal tubes add a handsome character to the ride. According to Lin, the sculpture-inspired design lends the electric motorbike a soulful resonance to the otherwise emotionless motor.",
            "Here the speed can be converted into a low-frequency resonant sound that binds the emotions and elicits a fresher man-machine relationship. On the Euterpe 9 resonant metal tubes of varying lengths are installed on one side of the machine, so as to create different frequencies of harmonic resonance with the speed of the bike. These metal installations are integrated into the body of the bike in a way that they flow with the inherent shape of the two-wheeler. The side wind blows at an almost vertical angle across the metal tube opening, and sound frequency increases or decreases with speed. Another variation is added when the biker leans around the bend, thereby producing a slightly different sound.",
            "In this concept design, the visual extension and linearity have eliminated space above the battery, thereby permitting for a curved fold above the body giving the EV a lightweight and futuristic feel. At low speeds below 80 kmph the high-pitched waves are produced since the valve is closed. Riding at speeds above 80 kmph will open up the valves of resonance tubes turning the tube into an Opened-pipe Standing Waves tube."

Compact electric scooters have garnered attention owing to this fact. But one has to consider their function and looks as well, to be considered an attractive proposition for riders.",
            "Designer: Fajar Ismail",
            "The Stellar electric scooter falls right in the sweet spot of a highly functional and stylish commuter with something more to keep riders hooked. It’s envisioned as a compact fun ride for short-mid-range distance commutes sans any emissions. To feed the battery with more juice, there’s a solar panel embedded in the front flat section. As far as my imagination goes, the scooter will benefit the maximum from the limitless sun’s energy in tropical regions. Take it out of the city for motocamping or other weekend outdoor activities, and you’ll be in for a fun time.",
            "According to the designer, the two-wheeler is based on the Quest Atom Alpha EV chassis and on other end of the spectrum draws inspiration from spacecraft design too. The lightweight electric scooter gets added features to improve riding comfort and efficiency. Styling ques follow a layered geometric design emulated in the aluminum body panels. For better rideability on rough surfaces, the scooter gets a modern dual springer fork and a rigid frame for structural strength.",
            "For once, a concept two-wheeler design doesn’t ignore the riding comfort of the seat (we’ve seen way many with very eye-sore aesthetics) which is a big relief. A digital display or even an analog tachometer would have been a wise addition, but other than that, this urban scooter manages to do everything right."

This urban commuter is more than just a means of transportation and inclines more towards an entertainment space. To be precise, it’s a car for social gamers who want a quaint, personal cocoon for getting into the zone. The core idea of the design is inspired by the socialized gaming culture in Korea, and other elements are also prompted by their living style. Take for instance the floor-sitting culture (for eating, sleeping and hanging out) and the 24/7 delivery services in the region. All this reflects in the unique hybrid seating for a flexible environment in the Allo.",

The interior is flush with built-in screens (with swivel arms and rollable ones too), controllers, and all the tech gamers demand in their personal space. To give the interior feel of airiness, fresh light-hued colors including mint green and sky blue are used.",
            "Since the adaptation of 24/7 delivery services is one of its USPs, the van comes with its own detachable robot for pick-up and delivery. The robot is a part of the interior space on the rear, and once it attaches back to the vehicle with all the eatables and drinks, the in-car gamers can take a little break from all the action to enjoy the munching. In fact, the in-car entertainment software comes with three modes – Game, Rest and Delivery – to help users enjoy gaming and then spend quality time relaxing with friends and family. The designer imagines the Allo to have its own cloud gaming service wherein the users can explore and purchase games from any platform without any strings attached.",
            "The concept is not a mere run-of-the-mill creation, rather it’s based on intensive behavior research and insights into the user experience and industrial design. Allo in a crux is the journey that pulls the passenger into the imagination of the future of mobility which will have gaming and entertainment as an integral part of it.

The folding central supports on the front and rear sides have the swing down windows that hang on to the ceiling when moving up or down. So, the occupants have a bed-to-ceiling view that most campers will appreciate. If you’re skeptical about privacy, the topper comes with window covers. The upper walls are upholstered to keep the space warm and comfortable which all goes well for camping in any kind of environment.",

In addition to this, Rossmönster is offering an additional $4,000 Expedition Pack complete with roof rails, outside ladder, front LED light bar and MOLLE panels. Lagom weighs around 350 – 400 lbs depending on the truck and its bed size, and also the additional chosen options.",

This is in part also attributed to the 20” Salt Tracer BMX tires capable of absorbing impact. At the heart lies a highly efficient 250W geared drive BLDC electric motor capable of churning out 45nm torque which has been extensively tested in performance trials. This has resulted in an engaging and effortless driving experience for Gen-Z users.",

It gets a maximum climbing angle of 12 degrees on electric power, and beyond that, you’ll have to do some effort to keep the kick bike in motion. One thing I like about this electric kick bike as compared to other options is that it doesn’t make any impractical steep claims. The pre-orders for the limited run of the Pipegun 1 are open now, and it already looks like a good deal at a price tag of $2,100."

            "Rather mysteriously titled the SDAP, this little concept car from Mexico-based designer E. Maximiliano Salas was designed to be equal parts exotic and enigmatic… although its 80s automotive references are all too common.  With pop-up headlights that are a grand reference to a bygone era of supercars, the SDAP has a little Countach and Diablo, and a little ’84 F40 mixed into it, making it quite the eclectic beast.  The dark-ish rendering isn’t by accident either, Salas wanted his unusual concept to have a little waiting-in-the-shadows vibe to it, harking back to yet another phenomenon of the 80s, the reveal of the time-traveling DeLorean in the film Back To The Future.",
            "Designer: E. Maximiliano Salas",
            "Salas’ design doesn’t give us much to work with as far as a text description goes, but the images speak a lot for themselves. In trying to modernize the Countach and F40, Salas took the route that most modern cars tend to take with their design – a minimal approach with form and color, giving the car a certain raw, edgy, cyberpunkish appeal. I wouldn’t outright say that the car is trying to be a lithe version of a Cybertruck, but the silver body, the use of prominent edge lines, ad that flat rear with the LED-strip taillight says otherwise. In a lot of ways the rear references the F40’s flat rear surface, while the front boasts of concealed pop-up headlights that feel like a spiritual successor to the F40 and the Countach. That logo on the hood also looks rather a lot like the aforementioned brands too.",
            "What catches my eye instantly is the car’s surfacing, which definitely feels modern more than anything. SDAP’s contours are MUCH more refined and tight, almost looking like a wind tunnel test was brought to life. That side profile is perhaps the most beautiful part of the car, with how the waistline moves from the front to the back. The front has a signature wedge shape that obviously gets resolved as you reach the first wheel. However, the line then curves downwards just to tease the viewer, and then upwards finally before trailing off at the end. Even in the render below, you can clearly see the two edge lines on the hood moving backward and taking a beautiful dramatic curve near the windshield. Sure, there isn’t an abundance of accent lines, cutouts, vents, or any extraneous details on the SDAP. It’s minimalist in almost every sense, yet it does a phenomenal job with what it has, resulting in a car that definitely looks like a modern take on the Countach or the 1984 Ferrari F40."

Wayne, who works out of his home and garage in South Africa, designed this piece for a client who commissioned the project and even supplied him with an R nineT to work with. The final build, which he refers to as ‘Storm’ takes inspiration from the aerodynamic forms seen on aircrafts. While the Storm can’t fly like its inspiration, it evokes a feeling of weightlessness in whoever rides it, thanks to its form that slices through the air the way an airplane would. The custom R nineT even sports two massive air scoops on its base that keep the motorcycle’s boxer engine cool and breezy.",

There isn’t a single straight line on this bike and that’s honestly refreshing after the Cybertruck copycats we’ve been seeing for the past 3 years. It’s worth noting that the bike’s aluminum fairing was built entirely by hand, but more importantly, it was built freeform, without any prior sketching, modeling, or template-building. If that wasn’t impressive enough, Wayne’s metal-forming skills are also entirely self-taught.",
            "Designing and building the bike was an eight-month-long endeavor from start to finish. The client provided Wayne with a low-mileage R nineT, and for the most part, the entire motorcycle uses pretty much all the original stock parts on the inside, although Wayne had to make a few customizations and rearrangements to bring his design to life.",
            "In keeping with the Storm’s aeronautical theme, Wayne built the entire bike out of aluminum sheeting, with multiple parts coming together and screwing on to look like panels on an airplane. The various body panels interlock with one another, connected via small Allen head fasteners that resemble the rivets you’d find on aircraft. A silver coat of paint gives the Storm its raw appeal, looking like an aircraft sans the aerospace paint.",
            "The custom R nineT has a rather interesting front and side profile, and chances are you’d never guess that there’s a BMW underneath that Iron Giant-esque aluminum fairing. The bike’s front boasts a dome-ish cover that is only punctuated by a single headlight located at the center, almost like a plane’s nose. In keeping with the airplane-inspired enclosed design, Wayne also covered both the front and rear wheels, and also modified the exhaust to make it less prominent. The exhaust now sits right below the boxer engine, with three holes to eliminate hot air instead of having it trapped inside the aluminum body. That scooped air intake on the back? Well, Wayne added that (along with an inner fan) to keep the repositioned oil cooler at a lower temperature.",
            "The Storm also boasts of a unique dashboard, with buttons to control specific functions of the bike, and a central speedometer, looking a lot like something you’d see in a vintage cockpit. There’s also a stealthy seven-segment display hidden under the mesh panels below the dashboard. The Storm also boasts of a keyless ignition, with a remote-controlled start.",
            "While it seems like Wayne has a talent for building custom motorcycles (make no mistake, he definitely does), his original training is as a millwright (designing/building/maintaining grain mills). After spending 15 years in Canada, Wayne moved back to his homeland in South Africa, but found himself without a job. It was around that time that he took to custom bike-building, carrying his prior skills in welding, machining, fabrication, and electrical and mechanical work to his new hobby. The one skill Wayne found himself without was shaping aluminum sheets – something he picked up with relentless practice, hammering the panels out on a tree stump and then finishing them by hand.",
            "Wayne now is the founder and sole proprietor of FabMan Creations, with an upgraded garage and workshop that he uses to build custom bikes and fabricate parts like fuel tanks, fenders, and exhaust systems."

The original gasoline-guzzling Mustang was an icon in itself, and Ford’s choice to steer away from that very iconic aesthetic seemed odd at first, but the company justified its choice by rightfully pointing out that the Mach-E wasn’t the same as the original muscle car. It was entirely different on the inside, hence the difference on the outside. The justification made sense, but it didn’t provide any closure. However, this electric Mustang by Charge Cars is rather wonderfully filling that void. Debuted at the beginning of 2022 but only unveiled officially to the public at this year’s Salon Privé Concours, the Charge Mustang is everything you want an electric Mustang to be. It retains the original car’s raw, muscular persona, albeit with a ‘new drivetrain who dis’ appeal.",

            "Easily one of the most visually impressive electric cars that money can buy, the Charge Mustang bases its design off the iconic 1967 Fastback. If its body looks almost too similar to Ford’s own ’67 Mustang, it’s because Charge Cars uses a bodyshell that’s officially licensed by Ford. Underneath this shell, however, sits Charge’s electric platform, with floor-mounted batteries that make the Mustang an electric little pony.",
            "The electric platform that the Mustang sits on is the result of a strategic partnership with Arrival, the UK-based automotive startup that’s working with Uber to create their bespoke electric taxi-cabs. The one sitting under the Charge Mustang has permanent magnet e-motors on all four wheels, and a 63 kWh battery between them under the rider, giving the car a range of 200 miles on a full charge. This revised electric Mustang has a few other impressive specs, like the ability to go from 0-60mph in 3.9 seconds, and a motor torque of 1520Nm.",
            "The Charge Mustang’s design, however, remains its most beloved feature. With an aesthetic that has major The Batman energy (after all the Batmobile used in the 2022 film is a muscle car too), the Charge Mustang comes in a black exterior, with carbon fiber paneling and a radiator grille on the front, even though the car has an electric powertrain on the inside. Notably, the Mustang’s iconic horse symbol on the radiator gets replaced with Charge’s logo, a strange minimalist crucifix. The headlights and taillights have an unmistakable beauty to them too, opting for a lighter, more minimal outline design rather than solid lights.",
            "The electric Mustang also has a few other tricks up its sleeve, in the form of Traffic Sign Detection and an Automatic Emergency Brake. It also has Level 1 autonomy in the form of Cruise Control and Lane Departure Warning (we’re still ways off from an autonomous Mustang).",
            "The electric platform under the Charge Mustang was thanks to a hardware and software partnership with Arrival. The car’s dashboard and interiors get an overhaul too, with a more modern design and the presence of dynamic screens behind the steering wheel as well as the center of the car’s dashboard.",

Clearly designed as a premium limited-edition vehicle, the Charge Mustang starts at £350,000, with extra modifications to the car’s performance or its interiors adding to its overall cost. While it obviously means a majority of us will never really get to own this beauty, I guess there’s vicarious pleasure to be had in seeing someone actually revive the classic muscular car as an electric beast!"

            "Electric kick scooters are the definitive future of personal commuting owing to the exponential rise in the number of vehicles on the road and the colossal impact of carbon emissions on the planet.  That justifies our obsession with kick scooters lately, and we’ve stumbled over another three-wheeled version that’s a pure delight to watch and presumably to ride on as well.",
            "Dubbed the Electric Stand Bike, this striking creation is the Polestar O2 Convertible of the electric kick scooter world. The personal commuter is fit for riding the city streets as well as the outskirts in maximum style without impacting the environment. The electric-powered machine has bigger front wheels and a single rear one for maximum control. In fact, the front wheels are almost triple the size of the rear one which comes with its own independent dual suspension system to take on the bumps with maximum ease.",
            "Designer: Alexandr Zhukouski",
            "The standing platform is big enough to provide a comfortable upright stance while turning or when the ride gets rough. There’s an elaborate digital panel for all the vital telemetry including the current speed, remaining charge levels, and notifications from a connected mobile device. LED lights at the front have a good amount of throw for clear visibility of the oncoming traffic in the dark hours. The design incorporates storage space to carry along groceries or other essentials after a return trip from the supermarket.",
            "The wide platform on the Electric Stand Bike means there is enough freedom to change the riding position depending on the needs. That also brings in the possibility of keeping stuff (when the need arises) if there is no space left in the storage compartment. Overall, this kick scooter hits the right notes for modern urban commuters who want more than just a barebones ride for themselves. It’s all about style, practicality, and an assuring built that’ll last for years to come in all respects."

            "Purpose-built as a ride-hail car, or a taxi cab to be specific, the Arrival Car has the footprint of a small vehicle, but the spacious legroom of a much larger automobile.",
            "Created in partnership with Uber, the Arrival was designed to be the perfect car for ride-hailing. Unlike regular cars that were designed for ownership and just co-opted by Uber drivers, Arrival was built with the specific mindset of being a car meant for ride-hailing. This singular vision helped develop the car’s overall design, as its focus shifted from pure desirability and performance to efficiency, comfort, reliability, and affordability. A taxi cab for the future, Arrival even replaces the iconic yellow cab’s design with a modern, minimalist overhaul, trading in nostalgia for futurism – a concept Uber knows too well.",
            "Designer: ARRIVAL",
            "The Arrival car’s design language stands out for a bunch of reasons – its prime one being its ability to wonderfully blend into the background. Most cars are designed to catch eyes, but the Arrival isn’t about projecting desirability and oozing dynamics. It’s sleek and simple on the eyes, using visual cues that make it camouflage on the road – until you need to spot it. Unlike the yellow taxi that needs to be visible so you can holler and wave at it on the streets, Arrival’s relationship with its rider is much more discreet. Book the car on an app and it arrives to you – it’s a simplicity that allows the Arrival car to look as easy-on-the-eyes as it does. The car uses primitive boxy proportions and straight-ish lines that allow it to wonderfully merge into most blockish neighborhoods, while the use of silver/grey and black still make it look decidedly modern.",
            "The Arrival’s approach to design marks a major departure from how cars are usually designed because its prime focus is the car’s interior, rather than its exterior. A typical vehicle will drive 12,000 kilometers (7500 miles) per year, whereas a cab will cover more than 4x that amount, driving almost 50,000 kilometers each year (31,000 miles). That statistic immediately calls for a focus on two things – the car’s performance, but more importantly, its comfort. Designed to have significantly more legroom, the Arrival Car prioritizes driver comfort, allowing them to drive for hours at an end without feeling the fatigue of navigating roads daily. In fact, its interiors were designed in consultation and collaboration with various Uber drivers, factoring in their inputs and suggestions. The passenger cabin is designed to be much more spacious too, allowing them to travel in the lap of luxury – a user experience that’s arguably most important to Uber.",
            "Following the launch of Uber’s Clean Air Plan in London two years ago, more than £135m has been raised to support drivers with the cost of switching to a fully electric vehicle. Uber’s focus is now to encourage drivers to apply for EV Assistance under the Clean Air Plan.",
            "“The Arrival Car will join Arrival’s previously announced commercial products, the Bus and Van, to provide cities with a multi-modal zero-emission transportation ecosystem that they require in order to meet their sustainability goals over the coming years”, said the Arrival team in a press release. “This integrated transportation ecosystem will create cleaner, more equitable mobility solutions for people living in cities that Arrival believes will have a radical impact on their health and opportunities.”"

They’ve just revealed the limited edition 911 Sport Classic based on the retro-styled coupe of the 1970s, and I cannot stop staring at cit already in pictures. Based on the Type-992 wide-body 911 Turbo S, this limited-edition version for the North American market by the German sports car powerhouse is definitely more than the last 911 Sports Classic (Type-997 model) which just had 250 examples and was sold out within 48 hours. This one though will be up for grabs for 1,250 lucky buyers.",
            "The contoured Porsche is made under the Porsche Exclusive Manufaktur division and speaking on this project Alexander Fabig, Vice President of Individualization and Classic, said; “The Heritage Design models represent the most emotionally driven concepts of the Porsche product strategy. This unique approach sees the Style Porsche design department working with Porsche Exclusive Manufaktur to reinterpret iconic 911 models and equipment from the 1950s through to the 1980s and to revive design features from those decades.”",
            "Designer: Porsche",
            "This sports car is a 911 at its core powered by the 3.7-liter twin-turbo flat-six engine churning out 543 HP mated to a seven-speed gearbox. On the outside, it looks like the Sport Classic with the Ducktail Carrera RS 2.7 styled rear spoiler, front hood, and a cheesy double-bubble roof, all made out of carbon fiber reinforced plastic. Those twin stripes, 60 roundels, Fuchs-style rims, and the gold-toned 911 Sport Classic badging on the rear deck truly set it apart. Keeping the Classic’s essence alive, the air intake is done from ahead of the spoiler and the engine grille. The ride height on this exclusive model will be 10 mm lower courtesy of the Porsche Active Suspension Management Sport.",
            "The interior too gets the retro treatment with the two-tone Black and Classic Cognac embellished in aniline leather. Those seat centers and door panels get the Porsche houndstooth-like B7W Pepita cloth, and buyers can also go for the all-black interior but that is too boring, I think. The classic also gets the plaque above the glove box showing the car’s serial number, the door still plates with the Sport Classic logo, and the retro green armrest. The 70s theme carries on to the tachometer having retro-styled numerals and needles. Other unique inclusions are a sport Chrono clock, embossed headrests, sun visors and air-vent slats.",
            "Buyers will get to choose their 911 Sport Classic draped in exclusive Sport Grey Metallic skin with contrasting stripes in light Sport Grey. Else they can go for the Black, Agate Grey Metallic and Gentian Blue Metallic color options. Those who don’t mind the complete flair can go for the “PORSCHE” script and white lollipop decals with numerals. Ones who manage to grab this classic reinterpretation will also get the chance to buy an equally rare Chronograph 911 Sport Classic watch (matching the limited-edition vehicle) by Porsche Design.",
            "The 2023 Porsche 911 Sport Classic will come at a starting price tag of approximately $287,000 USD and deliveries will start in July 2022."

            "There is no stopping architects María José Váscones and Juan Alberto Andrade as they continue to develop designs ideal for living. The pair introduced to us the Domestico, a tiny and compact living space that promises more storage and function. The design is mainly for modern living in urban spaces. It doesn’t disappoint with the ample space and the warm aesthetics of the wood. The same natural element is used on the interior of the Dodo Van, which is mainly a house on wheels. It’s a Chevrolet Van (Chevy Van) that has been transformed into a small mobile home.",
            "Designers: Juan Alberto Andrade and María José Váscones",
            "The Dodo Van has been designed for a young couple who wants to live in a smaller place. The 1993 Chevy van was actually purchased for work and travel. Inside the van, you can see a full-sized mattress and a kitchenette with a fold-up dining table, and more.",
            "The Dodo Van is a design exercise that challenges transformation, limitations, and spatiality. The designers considered the needs of the young pair working with local communities. They are also frequent travelers who love to explore new places. They only take with them their essentials, so a small mobile home is just right.",
            "The Dodo Van can seat four to six people in five square meters (5 m2). Of course, that is a small area but the designers were able to make it a flexible environment just for the basic needs of living. The Dodo Van is small but it can comfortably accommodate a group of people. Of course, we can’t expect all of them to live there together, but it’s probably suitable for entertaining or outdoor travels. The first part holds the kitchen while the second one functions as storage. The third acts as a living space where you can chill during the day or sleep at night.",
            "There’s wood all over, which reminds us of the Domestico. The designers used 6mm plywood boards for the lining. The floor and the modules use 12mm and 15mm boards. For thermo-acoustic proper insulation, rock wool was actually used on the ceiling, walls, and the floor. There is an independent battery connected to the vehicle’s alternator for electricity. There is also a 110v transformer plus several lighting and outlets. There’s even proper drainage and a water system with tanks. Compared to other tiny homes on wheels we’ve seen, this one is simply a vehicle transformed into a living quarter."

            "Meet Reverso, an e-bike that reverses every single automotive design instinct ever. I guess we could attribute its design direction to the Cybertruck, which sort to challenge the norms too with a design that was strikingly different from anything that came before it. The Reverso sits firmly in that class too, with an aesthetic that I’m struggling to put together in words, only because I can’t really find a frame of reference.",
            "Designers: Miller Shapes Design & Denys Silich",
            "Analyzing the Reverso’s strange design turned out to be much more fun and insightful than I expected. It started with asking myself exactly what I found ‘wrong’ with the motorcycle’s design… then asking if those attributes were actually important in making something a ‘motorcycle’. After all, a motorcycle is exactly that – a motor attached to a cycle.",
            "My first response to the analysis on what I found odd about Reverso was its rejection of standard proportions. Motorcycles are shaped almost like animals. They have a torso, a head, a spine, and when viewed from the side, they have an almost feline or greyhound-like appearance. Reverso, on the other hand, doesn’t. That’s also due to the fact that Reverso shatters the second weird myth I had about motorcycles and automobiles in general – that curved bodies made for greater aesthetics and aerodynamics. The Cybertruck, at least if its performance specs are accurate, is nothing short of a fast beast – and I assume that the same stands for Reverso. Its chunky body with cuboidal forms definitely doesn’t epitomize elegance and speed – if nothing it looks robotic and has an impression of an almost mechanical agility to it.",
            "None of Reverso’s details or parts look ‘standard’ and that’s what makes the e-bike look so alluring. Aside from its wheels (which thankfully look like wheels and not hex-bolts), Reverso’s entire design looks odd. It has weirdly recessed headlights, a strange pair of perfectly rectangular side mirrors, a seat that definitely doesn’t look like your average ergonomic butt-rest, and a chunky torso that makes you really wonder what’s under the hood. Is there a fuel tank underneath there? Well, there jolly well could be, although the lack of a tailpipe makes me think otherwise. Where’s the battery located? Is it detachable? Is there extra storage? It’s normal to have these doubts – but that doesn’t necessarily make an e-bike’s design ‘bad’, does it?",
            "Well, to be frank, I’m still processing Reverso’s design and learning to stop myself when I find my brain hating something it doesn’t understand. It comes a lot easier knowing that Reverso is just a concept and not an actual e-bike. The Cybertruck, on the other hand, well, I’m still on the fence there."

Of course, a bed is just the tip of the iceberg when you’re trying to survive away from the trappings of modern life. There’s also the consideration of how you’ll even be able to bring all of the necessities, which is why some really ardent roadsters try to invest in an RV or camper. Not everyone has the budget for that or the space to have two vehicles, one for normal everyday use. Fortunately, you don’t have to choose anymore if you don’t mind having to put in or take out a big metal box whenever you switch between a weekday van and a weekend camper.",

The same, sadly, can’t be said about cars, almost all of which are designed with fixed forms and functions that are rigorously tested for road safety. Vans have enough space inside for modification inside but are likewise limited on what you can pull off on the outside.",
            "That’s what makes the XVan extension genius in its simplicity. You are, in a way giving up some of the seating space that would have been available in the back of your van, but you still have enough room for stuff when the module is collapsed inside. Of course, you might not have that space available at all anyway if you have decided to use the back of the van to carry your weekend wilderness equipment, with or without the XVan.",
            "The XVan is pretty much a large box that slots into the back of your van and extends out when you’re ready to settle in for the night. There’s a unique fold-out bed that is large enough for two persons, windows on both sides with a mosquito net, and blackout shutters for privacy. The setup for XVan puts two niches on both sides for your belongings, and there’s also a 50L chest under the bed for bulkier items.",
            "Beyond the “box” itself are the accessories that will make your life in the great outdoors a bit more comfortable, including a kitchen unit with a sink, a gas fire, a 40L 12V fridge, two 10L water tanks (clean and dirty), and a small gas bottle to make you somewhat self-sufficient during that short sojourn. You can even opt to have a “lounge area” with a removable table if you’re fine modifying the two front seats into swivel seats.",
            "The XVan is advertised to be compatible with many van models, so you don’t have to buy a new one just for this modification. What makes the XVan really special is how convenient and fast it is to use once the modifications have been made. It is advertised to take only 10-15 minutes to push in or take out the module thanks to the included lift table, and the motorized bed deploys in only a minute. It’s not going to be as comfortable or as fully featured as a camper, but you definitely can save up on space and money if you’re not the type that goes out for very long trips on the road and into the wilderness."

If the designer would not have made the Jin Roh reference, by instinct, I would have associated this mean machine with a future Batmobile.

The steering wheel has a folding structure that immaculately collapses into itself.",
            "The folding action is supported by the strong fiber threads running along the face of the wheel. Those sci-fi aesthetics of Lars’ proposed design are matched with the cool dual-color fabric inserts. The minimalism of this BMW steering wheel trickles down to the number of buttons available upfront. Only two knobs on each side are available to tweak the driving modes, and everything else is ditched. This hints at the use of this wheel in a BMW vehicle that has trimmed down interiors for complete relaxation. Interiors where simplicity and ambient visual appeal take precedence.",

While I’m restraining myself from labeling it a minivan, still it heavily weights on the side of one. We’ve already had our head over heels for the shape-shifting Skysphere roadster, this one is more from the conventional realm.

It’s no surprise the Urbansphere has seatbacks capable of 60 degrees recline and an extendable footrest means the occupants ride in utmost luxury. Audi is planning to add a large format and transparent OLED screen which pivots vertically down from the glass roof to divide the two seating rows just like a taxi divider.",

If the metrics are not right, it will offer personalized suggestions for stress relief. There will be calming wood accents inside the cabin and display panels on the central infotainment screen. The tech infusion doesn’t stop there – the car will be loaded with a pseudo assistant to make restaurant reservations, order groceries, or ferry the riders to the destination and find parking on its own.",
            "The vehicle will get the 800V architecture with 270 kW max DC charging speed., So, the Urbansphere will be capable of charging the 120 KwH battery pack from 5 to 80 percent in just 25 minutes.

            "Carmakers naturally tend to focus on how advanced cars will be in the future. They often put an emphasis on the conveniences of self-driving vehicles in an effort to reassure the public that today’s mishaps won’t exist in the future, at least ideally. Vehicles, however, won’t always be in transit, and while those visions and concepts might help solve traffic problems, many of them don’t address today’s parking problems. A more holistic mobility vision has to include the entire ecosystem, and that’s the idea behind this street project concept that makes a rather unusual proposition for solving parking space problems.",
            "Designer: Park Chanwoong",
            "The idea starts with street lamps, which the designer considers to be one of the more wasteful and underutilized spaces on streets. Of course, street lamps can be utilized for other purposes, like collecting environmental data, holding security cameras, or even using projectors to display ads on the ground. Project DORO, however, tries to put that unused space beneath the street lamp to better use as a parking space of the future, but it also requires a different kind of car to go along with it.",
            "Project DORO is actually a rather complex system that involves three parts of mobility. There is the actual base platform that actually has the wheels and the engine. It can detach from the cabin, which is the part where human passengers and drivers sit and connect to other cabins. This means that parked cabins that don’t need to go anywhere any time soon can have their platforms used on other cabins, potentially reducing the number of “complete” cars that have to be manufactured and be on the road.",
            "The cabin itself is an interesting exercise in design, where the interior is not unlike a living room, with the use of materials like wood, ivory, and fabric. Unlike most future car concepts, however, the capsule-like cabin has large windows that give passengers a clear view of the outside world, almost doing away with walls entirely. Presumably, these are one-way windows for the sake of people’s privacy.",
            "The street lamps in Project DORO serve as the home for unused cabins that are detached from their bases. The cabins are raised high above the ground to serve as shelter from rain or shade from the sun, though it might be debatable if anyone would want to stand underneath a heavy cabin. In the project’s vision, however, these street lamps line roads and highways, so cars will be traveling underneath these hanging capsules. Sidewalk parking that clogs up traffic will be a thing of the past!",
            "Project DORO is admittedly a rather grandiose and complex system, one that presumes there will be a reliable network of bases, cabins, and parking street lamps available in the future. That said, it is one of the few concepts that actually give the problem of parking some thought and doesn’t simply presume that the cars of the future cars will always be moving on roads and highways."

It can haul a rider weighing up to 125 kg, so most people are good to go.

In fact, every line and shape is crafted keeping in mind the needs of prospect users. This is apparent in the shock-absorption capability of the e-scooter with the independent 4-link suspension (just like in F1 cars) made out of composite materials working hard to absorb all the bumps. The three wheels (two at the front and one at the rear) and the tiltable fork help maintain the balance, and minimize the inertia while making tight turns. All this ensures a naturally comfortable and safe ride in crowded urban scenarios.",

So, the rider doesn’t have to worry about making his hands dirty. The commuter has a detachable 21 litres to stow groceries or any other accessories. The nifty monochrome display shows the current speed, mileage and total range of the ride. Smartphones can also be attached to have a glance at important notifications.",

            "Heat degradation can wear down the rotors on a bicycle, thereby adversely affecting the disks and the overall braking performance too. Also, the brake pads create abnormal noises due to this problem as the disk continues to rub against the brake pad. This all is attributed to the rotors wrapping in different amounts while braking. Most modern bicycles have hydraulic disc brakes as the standard which can cause such issues and a Taiwanese company wants to eliminate the evident issue with its innovative Two-Piece 3D Floating Rotor.",
            "Obviously, a rider cannot control the overheating or deformation inherent to the hydraulic disks as rotors currently available on the market don’t spring back to position once they cool down. The new rotor design by PSB wants to address this problem with its elastic and floating outer disk. There are spring rivets on the back of the rotor that create insulation between the outer and inner discs which ultimately prevent deformation. The cuts on the 6th and 12th ribs bring elastic function that further aids in achieving the intended result.",
            "Designer: PSB",
            "When the rider brakes, the angle cuts provide support as the margin space reaches the threshold and doesn’t affect the disc strength. This gives the disc ample space to move freely and deform – in fact about 85% larger than currently used floating rotors. According to PSB, this design brings a 1.8mm thick rotor at par with a 2.0mm rotor. As a result of all this, the uneven clamping can also be avoided to bring top braking performance to the fore. Overall, the service life of the bicycle is hugely improved with this invention. An additional bonus is the application of this rotor design equally well for electric bicycles, making it a commercially viable solution.",

The drag racing theme is spilled onto the rearrangement of the dash which now sits on top of the body kit behind the handlebars. Those clip-ons are mounted very low up front topped with the in-house translucent Frozen grips. Headlights and taillights have also been revamped with LED grid assembly, and they both are controlled by an Arduino controller.",

To this end, Hookie has taken out the control software to almost double the power delivery with almost a top speed of 100mph. The acceleration curve has also been toggled and now the bike only needs one brake that’s at the front. There’s a very RC motorcycle-like antenna at the rear but it has a purpose.

Yes, the LEGO Technic McLaren Formula 1 Race Car I’m talking about. The 1:1 LEGO version is on another level altogether owing to the amount of effort and time it took to create. After painstaking 1,893 man-hours of putting together 288,315 LEGO bricks of this 5.7-meter-long, 2.4-meter-wide brick-built, the end result is undeniably awe-inspiring.",
            "The creation comes with five separate components to take realism a notch higher. There are four wheels, car body, suspension and the crucial halo introduced a few years ago. McLaren revealed the LEGO F1 car today with Daniel Riccardo and Lando Norris looking more than just eager to test the removable halo and steering wheel. According to Niels Henrik Horsted, head of product at LEGO Technic, “We never stop trying to excite and inspire our fans by pushing the limits of possibility through the technology and designs produced, both on the racetrack and with LEGO building.”",
            "Fans who’re set to visit the circuit this weekend to witness the race in Melbourne will be in for this surprise too. The LEGO McLaren Formula 1 Race Car will be on the trackside, and fans can actually sit inside the cockpit to make their time special in every respect. For those who are not lucky enough to experience it in reality, the next best thing is to get the scaled-down Technic McLaren Formula 1 Race Car model which is once again up for backorder on the official website, and also available via global retailers."

            "Every year starting around March, designers collectively participate in a 36-day endeavor called the ’36 Days of Type’, where each day, designers express their creativity by redesigning letters and numbers from the alphabet (A-Z followed by 0-9). The challenge primarily sees participation from visual designers, illustrators, and 3D modelers, although this unusual entry from Yash Mathur beautifully transcends design disciplines by creating an automotive-design-inspired typeface! Mathur looks to car brands and models for his inspiration, and cleverly reinterprets their headlights, turning them into letters and numbers. If there’s one thing worth commending here, it’s undoubtedly Mathur’s ingenuity, but along with it, one can’t help but appreciate how far headlights and taillights have come since the advent of LEDs. Thanks to halogens, LEDs, and edge-lit plastics, you can now virtually make a headlight or a taillight in any shape you choose. The only constraint here is brightness – since a headlight/taillight also serves a purpose, it needs to be bright enough. Although these light designs are purely conceptual, I do wish companies would embrace their headlights as a form of their branding (just like this Mercedes concept did!)",
            "Mathur’s project features virtually every brand you can think of, from the well-known Audi, Porsche, Tesla, Ford, and Lamborghini, to even a few lesser-known brands like Donkervoort, Oldsmobile, and W Motors. Mathur worked on this series during the first lockdown in 2020, and it only made sense to showcase it during this year’s 36 Days of Type! You can view the entire series chronologically by scrolling down. I’ll let Yash’s work do the talking.",

Also, the aggressive side panels are reminiscent of the Darth Vader helmet which will without doubt please Star Wars fans.",
            "Wheel rims carry the same sci-fi inspiration, bringing the element of boxy character to the hatchback which oozes with feature lines to convey speed and aggression. The texture of H03 hints towards its lightweight carbon fiber make, and the scratches and imperfections on closer inspection showcase the chaos of the dark side. The designer likes to put this as Duality Concept, and that’s pretty obvious with the contrasting dual-sided paint job – white on one side and black on the other.

From what we see in the teaser image, the EV is going to follow the norm with a modern silhouette and this concept gives our imagination wings. If we ignore the rear that looks more akin to the Bugatti Chiron, the EV could be pretty similar to what we see in these renders. A bold form factor with an intimidating front could be on the cards. The side profile has to be sharp and flowing with a supercar-like domineer but slightly bend towards the coupe persona too.

Designer Maitreya Dhanak’s absolutely wild Lotus Evanora Concept treats the chassis as a design element, resulting in a speedster that’s both visually and physically lightweight. Not to mention the fact that it looks like an exoskeletal beast!",
            "Designer: Maitreya Dhanak",
            "Christened ‘Evanora’ or Greek for ‘gift from the gods’, Dhanak’s concept falls in line with Lotus’ tradition of naming their vehicles beginning with the letter E. Dhanak’s approach towards designing the car deviates from the standard practice of taking a top-down approach. While most car designers have an internal framework pretty much ready, they always start with the outside and work their way in. Dhanak, on the other hand, designed an outer structure to complement the inner structure. The skeletal bodywork you see was designed to clad just the chassis, resulting in an aesthetic that’s quite literally as minimal as it gets. The results speak for themselves – since the body (made from carbon fiber) covers just the chassis and nothing else, it uses lesser material, and naturally creates pockets for air-flow, creating a car that’s light and airy both in perception and in reality!",
            "“The support structures are inspired by the shape of branches of trees”, Dhanak says. “These form a network of support structures that help in keeping the weight of the car low and increasing structural rigidity while being visually unique as well.” In turn, they guide airflow in a way that helps cool the car as well as create the downforce necessary to hit higher speeds.",
            "Dhanak’s concept is quite reminiscent of the HV-001 by Ayoub Ahmad, which featured a similar-looking generative-designed stylized chassis. It feels almost like a trend in the making, where cars can now rely on advanced algorithms and materials to achieve an incredibly aesthetic bare-basics look that tends to discard all that’s unnecessary, shedding weight and looking leaner and meaner in the process!"

The goal was simple – to go at breakneck speeds for the rush of driving. Fast forward to 2022 and we are seeing a sped-up shift in the adoption of electric vehicles owing to global climate change concerns.",
            "So, are we going to see the legacy of hot rods finally be done and dusted? Not at all, if we have concepts like Erode 002 turn into reality in the future. Keeping the spirit alive of the classic automotive trend, the electric hot rod pictured here will make any speedster lover go crazy. More than just an aspiration, this hot rod does make complete sense as electric powertrains are getting more powerful, thanks to the exponential automotive development as far as electric powertrains are concerned. Without question, the amount of torque and bhp they’ll generate will perfectly complement the personality of a speedster like Erode 002 on the loose.",
            "This creation has the typical hot rod character, a sleek body with an open roof, and open front and rear wheels for the intimidating stance. Those exposed suspension components on the front truly reassure the car’s powerful domineer. The fact that it will be powered by an electric motor, means it will be lightweight and quite agile. Modern looks are also important, so the Erode 002 gets an LED light bar spanning across the rear, five-spoke wheels draped in red, and those typical thin wing mirrors that remind me of the spiking Hot Wheels era.",

Almost ironically, a lot of the showcases there revolved around virtual experiences, particularly the kind that the Metaverse movement is trying to push. Being physically present in one place while also virtually experiencing a different location at the same time is one of the biggest premises of this convergence of technologies, but most of those involve wearing some form of headset, be it VR goggles or more stylish AR glasses.

There’s a modular mini-fridge, for example, that even includes an induction range on top for cooking on the go. The spacious cabin of the OMNIPOD can be an office space or a recording studio, depending on your need at the moment. And, of course, the car’s screens will change to create a virtual environment that makes you feel as if you’re really at work, perhaps to help boost your productivity.",
            "Given the events of the past two years, there are also elements of sanitation in this moving living space. An “Air Shower,” for example, blasts passengers with negatively ionized air to remove dust and germs, while an LG Styler can hold your coats and shoes to sanitize them and keep them clean until you need to wear them again. And after each trip, the car’s virtual assistant Reah will flood the cabin with UV light and get robot vacuums rolling to prepare for its next use.",
            "While some of these technologies might already be available today, all these futuristic conveniences hinge on electric vehicles perfecting their self-driving capabilities. The LG OMNIPOD does have the option of manual driving, but without the typical steering wheel and controls anyway. It’s not going to replace RVs and cabins on wheels, especially with its lack of bathrooms and kitchens, but LG’s vision of future mobility does interesting points and questions, like how humans of the future might find it harder to be physically social when they don’t even have to step out of their cars most of the time."

            "Although mostly inspired by Polestar’s Precept in terms of the basic aesthetic, this concept almost takes the language to the extreme and squashes the car almost to a box. The Passion-Sharer has sharper lines and edges than a typical car, and its lowered cabin makes you wonder if there’s even space for human passengers.",
            "The secret is that the seats are actually reclined so far back that they’re almost horizontal, an angle that is more associated with sleeping rather than riding a car. This odd position is all for the purpose of having a clear view of the tinted roof that acts as the only literal window to the outside world. Most of the time, however, the Passion-Sharer’s passengers will be viewing someone else’s sky, or at least that’s the idea.",
            "The “sky screen,” as it is called, can display real-time views of another Passion-Sharer owner’s sky, which would make it feel like they’re sharing the same sky. That does require that there are other car owners in transit during that time, though it’s entirely possible to simply have recorded footage for convenience. Of course, that touch screen interface can be used for other purposes, and it might be the only interface available in this car anyway.",
            "To some extent, this Polestar-inspired Passion-Sharer carries a lot more safety risks than other self-driving car concepts. Given the inclined seats and lack of other direct controls, it would be almost impossible for humans to intervene in case of an emergency. It is a concept that requires autonomous driving technologies to be perfected before people can peacefully enjoy a serene sky without minding the heavy traffic in front of them."

            "The designer’s idea may be four years old, but it can still be used, especially during this pandemic. This actually reminds us of the Ford Clint Autonomous Vehicle Interior. This time, we see an autonomous ride-sharing service that includes an app and a modular interior for future vehicles.",
            "Designer: Conner Stormer",
            "The system requires users to use and access the Gogo app. Your frequented locations are saved automatically within the app. This allows easier access for faster use during future rides.",
            "Within the GOGO app, you can also view the places of your friends, family, and other contacts. In addition, you can check out new connections by linking with other social networks. The more contacts and connections, the more the app can remember and provide information that you need.",

Usually, like most ride-sharing apps, Gogo connects riders that travel similar routes. Users can also select to add passengers as potential ride buddies. You can set your profile to private if you want more privacy and security.",
            "The modular interior also allows a more customizable commuting experience.

The modular interior allows riders to configure the seats, while the mobile app will enable you to choose if you want to share the ride with another passenger or more. Ridesharing actually has benefits including the freedom to be entertained on your own (play games, surf the web, watch a TV show), meet new people, be productive by preparing for work or catching up on the news, and efficiency.

With its semi-deployed landing gear, those who walk beneath will feel as if it is coming in for a landing. The interior space of this niche installment in the city will be used to host events, hold meetings and act as an office space or leasing properties.  There will be a public gallery too which will be open for visitors to explore.",

The flooring will transition into the plane’s interior seamlessly which in itself will be a unique experience.",

There aren’t too many details on the car’s specifics, especially considering it’s a concept, but a few observations include the car’s gullwing-style doors, the rear-hatch that opens outwards probably to allow Batman to make a quick vertical entry or exit, and a turret-gun in the back in one of Wanoco4D’s versions. The Japan-based visual designer has been tinkering with the model since 2019, working on different iterations, details, materials, and lighting styles. Some of them have yellow lighting accents, sort of keeping in line with the original iconic yellow-and-black batman logo, while others rely on blue headlights, and red tail-lights. Wanoco4D even worked on a ‘stealth’ variant (shown at the bottom of the article) with a sandy-brown outer skin, designed to blend into a wasteland-style apocalyptic cityscape.",

While people don’t instantly connect the words Lamborghini and Batman at first glance, a quick look at their individual ‘brand attributes’ reveals quite a few similarities – Aggression, strength, dominating spirit, speed, and luxury too (after all, a Batmobile is far from being a cheap vehicle).

Subtle improvements in safety standards such as seatbelts, airbags and crumple zones absorb the impact in the best way possible. This is assisted by modern-day features such as blind-spot monitoring, lane assist and automatic braking systems.",
            "Designer: Aren Designs",
            "Even after such advancements there remain certain loopholes that can’t be plugged in due to physical limitations. For example, the crumple zone can only be extended to a certain limit while having any significant influence in distributing the impact force. Data suggests, during a frontal collision human body has to go through an acceleration of 20-30Gs or even more. Such high G forces can permanently damage brain tissues and induce fatal injuries. Aren Designs wants to get over this problem with an innovative cockpit design that works on the simple principle of converting potential energy into kinetic energy.",
            "Dubbed the Active Cockpit, this unique design reminiscent of a hamster wheel primarily seeks to address the severe impact of a head-on collision by turning the crash impact into rotational motion. The driver and passenger in the proposed two-seater vehicle are encapsulated in a spherical compartment, and as soon as an unfortunate collision happens, the rotational motion of the centrifugal force scatters the impact force, exponentially reducing the chances of injuries. Compared to the conventional car safety standards, this radical design could end up saving millions of lives once the working 3D printed prototype is ready to showcase the undeniable advantages.",

            "Rock climbing as a sport challenges the limits of human endurance to the extreme, and enthusiasts have to ensure everything is in place to make the exploits in the outdoors. Having an exciting journey in the mountains while being ultra-safe is important for every rock climber, and who would have thought an off-roading vehicle could do more than just ferry you to the base camp.",
            "The Audi AI-Climber is a concept targeted specifically for rock climbers who want to challenge themselves and break through the limits of exploration. Car design student Xiqiao Wang has conceptualized this rugged off-roading set of wheels for outdoor rock climbing lovers by envisioning the vehicle for three different modes.",
            "Designer: Xiqiao Wang",
            "The first one is the obvious ‘Driving Mode’ to ensure incredible off-roading experience on any kind of terrain, the second one is the ‘Protector Mode’ to full-proof the safety of climbers in the Rockies, and the third one is ‘Resting Mode’ for comfortable sleep during the night time in the safety of the four-wheeler or even being suspended from the rock wall.",
            "In the Protector Mode, the car turns into an intelligent belayer for solo adventurers who don’t have the liberty of a human belayer. There’s an elastic fall buffer wherein the climber can pull the rope in case of emergencies – as the climber falls down slowly to avoid any injuries. Also, there are two kinds of climbing protection options – the Lead climbing protection, wherein the rope is connected at multiple protection points, and the Top climbing protection, where the rope goes around the anchor. The vehicle itself is loaded with the mechanism to provide single rope, twin rope, or half rope, depending on the climber’s needs.",
            "The most interesting bit of the geometric Audi AI-Climber is the Resting Mode, in which the rear part loaded with a hanging tent detaches and is capable of taking flight solo. The whole rig flies to the anchor point on a steep cliff and anchors to the rock. Thereafter the tent deploys automatically, and the daring rock climber can enjoy the perfect night from the perfect vantage point. For the less daring climbers, the rig can be pitched on solid ground too.",
            "Other highlighting bits of the niche off-road vehicle are its terrain-adaptable tires with retractable treads, which can be employed in case more traction is needed. The interiors are designed for two travelers to comfortably sit back and enjoy the ride to the ultimate destination before the daring rock-climbing feat is undertaken!"

        "segments": [
            "2021 was a pretty interesting year for Ducati. It started off with a statement from Ducati CEO Claudio Domenicali, saying that the future of the company was electric, but by March 2021, Ducati’s VP of global sales and member of the board Francesca Milicia mentioned that an electric Ducati racer wasn’t feasible, considering the fact that “an electric motorcycle cannot guarantee the pleasure, the range, the weight, etc., that Ducati riders expect.” However, as soon as December rolled around, Ducati gave the world a sneak peek at the V21L, its first electric racing prototype. Its technology, however, remained carefully under wraps.",
            "“We exist in a motorcycling world that stands on the edge between combustion and electric”, says Daniel Kemnitz, passionate motorcyclist and the transportation designer behind the Ducati Ghost e-bike concept. “This is cause for a lot of controversy among riders, where some are open-minded to the electrified future, while others are less willing to part ways with their beloved passion as they’ve grown to know it.” The Ghost, Kemnitz states, was designed to be a bridge between the two worlds. “My Ducati concept, for clarification, is a hybrid motorcycle, not just in terms of the engine but also in terms of use case”, he adds. The bike is adapted to suit a modern environment where one can abide by emission/noise exclusion zones in city centers, while still being capable on backroads and long-distance trips.",
            "Designer: Daniel Kemnitz",
            "The Ducati concept, for that very reason, aims at nailing the aesthetic to appeal to a wider set of riders. It has a design that’s equal parts nimble and powerful, and embraces curves while rejecting the idea that powerful automobiles need to always look edgy. This unique aesthetic, along with design details that allow it to fit perfectly into Ducati’s motorbike family, means that there’s something in the Ghost’s design for everyone – whether you’re looking for a drop-dead gorgeous bike for in-city commutes or a beast that gives you long-range inter-city performance. Other standout details include the bike’s front suspension, which sits, right within the swingarm, between the headlights. The headlights themselves sit in a 4-way split design that’s rather ghostly to look at, and move your eye to the rear wheel and you’re treated to a unique closed hub design with the Ducati branding on it.",
            "The Ducati Ghost comes outfitted with a hybrid engine, featuring a single-drive with a slipper-clutch that can couple/decouple the electric drive as needed, “so you can either use the petrol engine in tandem with the electric motor, or you can use it as a generator for the batteries.”",
            "The use of a high-performance lightweight electric motor allowed Kemnitz to employ a complimentary small but high-revving horizontal twin-cylinder engine with a high peak power output. “Normally the weakness of such engines is that they have no torque in low/mid revs, but that’s where the electric motor assists”, Kemnitz states. Additionally, owing to the size of the small engine, it is easier to optimize for fuel efficiency too, using modern cam-less electric valves to achieve a healthy balance between performance and efficiency at the same time without any compromise. This hybrid system also allows for tighter packaging and component size, saving weight in the process and allowing the Ghost to have a narrower frame. Thanks to the presence of a battery pack located closer to the ground, the Ducati Ghost can get away with a smaller fuel tank, a nifty opportunity that allowed Kemnitz to streamline the tank’s shape right into the rider’s seat, improving rigidity and the overall build.",
            "The final benefit to having a distributed hybrid-style power system is that you’ve always got a plan B ready no matter what. In the case of the Ducati Ghost, the batteries aren’t the central power delivery system, which allows them to act as a sort of ‘reserve tank’ for extra power. To that very end, the Ghost comes with detachable batteries that can be swapped at Ducati dealerships for an easy and quick recharge between rides. “This would also act as a touch point between Ducati and its customers, to provide more interaction options for both”, says Kemnitz."

Buttons and knobs will be a thing of the past, replaced by slick screens you can simply glide your finger on. Reality, however, still needs to catch up with our imaginations, and our fingers and hands are still critical in how we interact with cars.",

            "Touch screens provide more controls and functionality in a small amount of space, while buttons, dials, and switches are not only limited functionality but also restricted by the laws of physics. Until we finally make tactile touch screens a reality, however, there is one thing that physical controls can do that touch screens can’t provide. More often than not, you don’t have to look at a button to know that it’s on or off, nor do you have to look at a dial when twisting its knob.",
            "This “no look” functionality is critically important when driving, where your eyes should be on the road, not the touch screen. At the same time, we can’t feasibly turn back the clock on car dashboards, so we need a compromise that takes these needs and limitations into account. Enter the Electric Car Dashboard, where a simple, movable knob does the trick.",
            "Actually, that knob is anything but simple and is a sophisticated device on its own. It has a dynamic display on the top that changes its content depending on where you place it on the dash. It also acts as a button you can push to access more functionality that would otherwise require a second knob.",
            "The idea is that this dial gives drivers the necessary physical control they can turn in order to adjust the volume or the temperature without even looking at the screen. The knob’s function isn’t fixed, however, and you can move it to a different portion of the screen to make it control a different setting, like skipping to the next or previous track in a playlist. And in case there’s more than just one setting in that position, you push the knob’s button to switch to the next set.",
            "This kind of multi-functional dynamic knob isn’t just a concept, though. Microsoft already demonstrated this in action with the Surface Dial. Of course, there are plenty of things to iron out with this Electric Car Dashboard concept, and it isn’t a foolproof solution either. It is, however, a very interesting one that creatively combines the digital and the physical in a way that doesn’t compromise one or the other."

But don’t be mistaken about its ability to take on the bad blood. Conceptualized to be similar to the 1960s version which was more like a muscle car, the latest one goes back to the roots, giving up on sophistication to focus on realism and custom-built origins.

Now race designer and movie vehicle designer, Andries van Overbeeke gives us a peek into the basic concept design of the Batmobile for the movie. According to him, the very early Batmobile concept from 2019 showcases the nosebar, headlights and the tapered rear end. After kickstarting the very structural design of the Batmobile for the movie, artists like Ash Thorp took over the gauntlet, and the end result is stunning as we’ve seen in the movie.",
            "The muscle car character of the Batmobile driven by Robert Pattinson is pretty much in the DNA right from the beginning. It’s more like a Ford Mustang on steroids ready to ram anything in its path. The final version seen in the movie goes through many subtle changes, and in the end, it evolves as a lean and mean crime-fighting machine fit for Bruce Wayne. These initial blueprints also suggest the presence of a futuristic persona which was then roughened up to go with the movie’s plot. Either way, the Batmobile looks utterly impressive right from the conception stage to the final realization phase."

Things like charging history, the location of nearby Watt-enabled charging locations, and payment methods can be viewed in the app.",
            "Watt is truly a convenient and space-saving solution for the future dominated by electric vehicles, wherein, we’re going to have to deal with the problem of having enough charging stations for EVs. Even more so, the issue of building the infrastructure that requires ample space to accommodate vehicles in line for charging."

            "Living on another planet will be possible someday. It may not happen in our lifetime, but we can do our part for the next generation by preparing well for the possibility. Who knows, we may see that as technology is well advancing by leaps and bounds.",
            "Moon or Mars—where do you want to live? We can’t really say where the best place to live is, but we find it fun and exciting to imagine life in either of the two. You already have the Y3 Space-X Running Shoes for Mars and the Vollebak Mars Gear. Now let’s talk about what vehicle you will be driving. It can be the NASA Bike or the Star Wars-inspired Pandemax or this new project from Astrolab.",
            "Designer: Astrolab",
            "The Astrolab FLEX Rover may be available soon as it is currently being developed. It is not just a concept, but a company is already building the FLEX (short Flexible Logistics and Exploration). It doesn’t look like a futuristic or a fancy sports car, but it is designed to transport cargo and humans on the moon or Mars.",
            "The Astrolab FLEX rover is designed for humans to explore the place freely. It can be a rover or a lander, depending on a person’s need anywhere in the solar system. It boasts a modular payload interface that can support intermodal transportation. Astrolab has begun exploring solutions on living and operating on other planets. The company aims to design, build, and run a fleet of rovers someday.",
            "The FLEX rover supports exploration, robotic science, construction, logistics, resource utilization, and human operations on Mars or the moon. It can seat two astronauts on a removable deck and has a deck that can carry 3m³ of cargo. It comes with navigation and hazard detection sensors for semi-autonomous operations. In addition, it has solar panels to keep the vehicle powered.",
            "The wheels are ready for soft soil or the kind found on the moon or Mars. It’s like something we’ve seen in the movies before, but we know it’s really being built this time. As described, it has a versatile design that allows adaptive utility, last-mile cargo delivery, and crew transport in one vehicle.",
            "Astrolab believes in planetary discovery and exploration, and it is something the generation of our children may get to experience. The video above shows that the Astrolab FLEX Rover may be part of that future as a prototype is now fully operational. Chris Hadfield, a retired NASA astronaut, tested the FLEX and shared with us its role in the future.",
            "Hadfield, who is also an advisory board member of Astrolab, said, “it was not only a joy to drive FLEX but also see its size, capability and get an intuitive sense of what this rover can do.” He said equipment needs to change as we transition from the Apollo era to the future when we can live on the moon. “When we settle somewhere, we don’t just need to get people from one place to another, but we need to move hardware, cargo, life support equipment, and more. And it’s all dependent on mobility,” the astronaut also said."

            "Inspired by the skateboards and concept cars, this hybrid e-kick scooter adopts a future-facing design to shape-shift wheelbase depending on the needs of the rider.",
            "Kick scooters have now been the more trendy and sensible option to commute in the cities. So have been the skateboards which can be seen in every corner owing to their cool factor and flexibility to not only ride the roads but also the pavements or stair rails depending on the user’s skill level. So why not combine the best of both worlds and create a kick scooter that has the bright prospect of making it to the consumer market?",
            "Designer: Dailyn Kim",
            "The EXT E-Kick Scooter by Dailyn Kim is the perfect example of an electric kick scooter done right. The reason – there are countless kick scooter ideas already on the market and this one brings a new dimension of riding. The EXT is designed keeping in mind the flexibility to switch between short and longboard modes. Apparently, the shortboard configuration on a kick scooter enhances speed and performance for power users, while the longboard form supports comfort and balance.",
            "Delightfully, the EXT E-Kick Scooter can do both thanks to its extendable wheelbase that can make the quick switch between the short and longboard configuration to support both the riding modes. This is done by the extendable and retracting wheelbase which alters the length by 3 inches. The deck extends above the rear wheel which essentially creates a wheelbase to slide easily. There are no complex mechanisms that pose a challenge to the function of the electric kickboard, and that’s big merit here.",
            "Dailyn creates a deck with an arc and patterned grip for a more comfortable stance while riding. The ease of use extends to the driving aid in the form of a thumb throttle and brake. There’s a dynamic touchscreen to keep the rider abreast with all the information such as current speed, battery charge levels, listening to music, and navigation aid for snaking through the dense suburbs. The rims get a reflective pattern for visibility to other motorists in the nighttime."

            "With a muscular, sinewy, characterful silhouette, it’s difficult to ignore the Aeolus. The e-bike, envisioned by India-based designer Prathmesh Banubakde, models itself on the likes of other hyperbikes, notably from brands like Suzuki and Ducati who command the space. Its body is elegant, yet far from sleek. It has curves where it needs to, sports large forms/volumes in places where you’d expect it to, and is the kind of hyperbike you’d take second and third glances at, just to appreciate how perfectly proportioned and beautiful its design is.",
            "Designer: Prathmesh Banubakde",
            "The Aeolus has some unique design details that immediately stand out to the viewer, from the incisive, edgy headlight on the front to the bike’s very form, which seats the rider in a triangular stance, commonly seen with GP motorcycles. The bike almost seems like it’s leaning forward, and it encourages the rider to do so too, taking on a much more aggressive riding position that’s synonymous with aerodynamism and speed.",
            "A breakdown of the Aeolus provides a detailed look at the hyperbike’s assembly. A massive battery pack sits between the rider’s knees, right in front of the motor which powers the bike’s rear wheel. The designer even outfitted the Aeolus with a CPU, although I assume that it just powers the hyperbike’s dashboard, which lets you access things like driving modes, navigation, and battery levels. An interesting aspect of the Aeolus’ design, however, is the retention of the signature fuel tank ‘hump’, even though the bike isn’t fuel-powered. This hump, however, acts as the Aeolus’ storage compartment, letting you stash anything from a helmet to a backpack right within the bike, and securing it with a lock and key.",
            "Ultimately, the Aeolus is less of a concept bike built for production, and more of a concept aimed at form exploration. Prathmesh’s inspiration board looked at everything from MotoGP bikes to organic architecture and even the odd stealth fighter jet. The hyperbike’s main beam definitely draws inspiration from computational and organic architecture, while the bike’s fascia alternates between edgy/aggressive, and curvy/flowy."

Under normal circumstances, EV owners have to look out for electric charging stations in their vicinity when the battery is running out. But what if there is no charging station nearby for miles in every direction?",

As the name implies, it is a charging station on wheels, ready to rush to your location to juice up the empty battery to continue the trip. Shaped like a big RC car, the autonomous electric charging station is the ideal thing to bank upon when you are stranded in the middle of nowhere. This unmanned mobile charging station can be called b the user to the current location via an app. With a top speed of 120 kmph, the moving electric charging service is a viable product for the EV-dominated future.",
            "MECS is loaded with cameras and sensors to detect the road conditions and the surroundings to navigate safely to the location. Once it arrives at the called location, the back cover can be lifted up by pressing a button to use the internal chargers (two charging types) or spare battery inside. The AI-enabled vehicle charging pod returns to the nearest hub to fill up its battery and be ready for another stranded commuter. Design One also envisions the MECS to lend its duty as an observer in case of emergencies like natural calamity or war situations.",
            "How practical the concept here can be in real-life situations is subjective as the stationary electric charging infrastructure is increasing in developed countries, and the developing countries are following suit. To charge up the MECS vehicles too, infrastructure will be required in remote locations which in itself will be a challenge."

These visions often involve highways that are so clean and spacious that it’s possible to conveniently and safely cruise roads without bumping into another self-driving car. Given today’s traffic congestion, however, that’s a far too idealistic vision. One concept sticks a bit closer to reality while leaving the doors of possibility wide open, envisioning how cars can travel more quickly using the same technologies that power Japan’s famous bullet trains.",

            "People want to travel fast, but few actually know how to do so safely, especially when it comes to staying on the right lane. Traveling at high speeds on a more or less straight path is something that Japan’s Shinkansen trains have already had mastered for decades. Unsurprisingly, this serves as the seed for this concept of a Shinkansen car that can travel both on regular city roads and on high-speed maglev tracks.",
            "Taking inspiration from both the N700 train that launched into service in 2007 as well as Mitsubishi’s design language, the “Mitsubishi Shinkansen” exhibits a sleek, aerodynamic design that is almost reminiscent of a real bullet. The concept doesn’t exactly show passenger doors, so the design looks unbroken and whole, reducing the possible air friction that will come from seams.",
            "What gives this car concept its dual capabilities are the retractable “fins” along its side that slide out when the car is traveling on a maglev highway. The magnets in these fins help propel the car at high speeds, pretty much like how bullet trains work today. Additionally, the maglev track can also charge the car while en route, thanks to power coils on the car’s belly as well as on the ground, just like today’s wireless charging technologies.",
            "The Mitsubishi Shinkansen offers an interesting and slightly different glimpse of future travel, utilizing tracks that will let cars travel safely at high speeds. At the same time, it also showcases a futuristic car design that embraces Mitsubishi’s design language, like its “dynamic shield” fascia, reinterpreted in a way that would look out of this world when standing beside the carmaker’s current roster. Like a bullet, its form clearly marks it for speed while still maintaining an approachable design that makes it into what the designer calls a “car for the whole family.”"

Predictably Ash didn’t disappoint as the Batcycle came out to be truly badass. One that will pop any eyeballs in the vicinity.",

The automotive community is all praises for the portrayal of the vehicles the Gotham’s protector is riding – the Batmobile in particular. Not far behind is the fresh Batcycle which was not as prominent as the four-wheeled accomplice.

But on closer inspection, the monster has got its DNA derived from other parts of the globe. Yes, we are coming right there where all you automotive fans put your money on. The Batcycle’s extended wheelbase is a spitting image of the custom Suzuki Hayabusa bikes. This by the way helps in high-speed stability to shoot those adrenaline-inducing high-speed chases. The exposed frame is a nod to the Italian origins from the house of Ducati. So, we don’t blame you for the irresistible urge to take this badass crime-fighting machine for a spin in the neighborhood in your daydream.",

The engine is a flat-four with the crankshaft positioned perpendicular to the swingarm. He says in the Instagram post that the idea was to “match the brutal and blunt designs from the Batmobile with a solid rear swingarm that would then connect to an exposed lattice-type frame found in some of my favorite Ducati bikes.”  Just like the Batmobile, the Batcycle’s rugged form is a testament to the fact that Bruce Wayne could in reality have crafted these machines to go with the Batman’s alter ego!"

            "Using a technique called parametric design or generative design, automotive designer Ayoub Ahmad created the HV-001 by defining a set of conditions and allowing 3D algorithms to create an organic-looking automobile to fulfill those conditions. If the design looks almost like a skeleton, that’s no coincidence because natural evolution works the same way too – it designs skeletons based on a certain set of conditions. Humans have strong heels and tailbones for standing and sitting, birds have lightweight skeletons for flying, and goats have strong skulls for occasionally headbutting.",
            "The car’s chassis itself becomes its body, with an exoskeletal framework that’s so organic and beautiful, it would be a shame to hide it under a fascia. The HV-001’s unique exterior tries to achieve strength and aerodynamism with as little material as possible, resulting in open spaces where material isn’t necessary, and connective pillars in places that take on gravitational stress, physical loads, or mechanical pressure. As far as surfaces go, the HV-001 opts for an almost mesh-like surface that has its own dimples or negative spaces to remove unnecessary material and reduce the car’s weight, making it more energy-efficient.",
            "Designer: Ayoub Ahmad",
            "The car’s uniquely skeletal design isn’t unlike the Formula 1 perfume bottles Ross Lovegrove designed in 2019 (he used parametric design too). With such intricately complicated forms, it’s almost axiomatic to rely on 3D printing to build out your creations. The car’s design definitely hints at being 3D printed, with the number of undercuts, contours, and complex surfaces all across its exoskeleton. The unique organic design isn’t just limited to the car’s chassis – its wheels have organic 3D printed rims, and the car’s cockpit (even its steering wheel) echoes the same organic generative design language. I wasn’t kidding when I said the HV-001 was almost entirely designed by algorithms!",
            "The three most common parameters that define such designs are A. Strength, B. Minimal material/weight, and C. Aerodynamics to limit drag and boost efficiency. Simply looking at the car’s contours help you understand what path the air would take as the car cuts through it. The vehicle has a defined contour running along the sides, and an abundance of air intakes and outlets to keep the vehicle cool even when it hits maximum speeds. Fins on the back help cut and channel air too, and the lack of a traditional exhaust system is enough to make an educated guess that the HV-001 is powered by an electric or hydrogen-powered drivetrain. The car is conceptual, however, and is most likely just a form exercise by designer Ayoub Ahmad, a Dubai-based automotive designer."

The idea of the Insecta must be based on the science of flying insects. You see, there are insects like the bees that they say shouldn’t be able to fly because of their body and wing size. It should be impossible, but bees can fly. If they can, then the Insecta and other flying cars also can—someday. And yes, planes and drones have been around, so we strongly believe this idea will become a reality.",

            "While LEGO’s own Batman is a fun, playful, and comical little character, this particular Batmobile adapted from the new Batman film (starring Robert Pattinson) isn’t particularly toyish. It might be pint-sized, but it’s still a brutish, no-nonsense, crime-annihilating machine.",
            "The 1360-piece Lego Technic set is modeled on the Batmobile seen in the movie, and comes with 2 unique ‘Light Bricks’ that illuminate the innards of the car, shining through the engine block and out of the grille to give the vehicle an eerie appeal.",

            "LEGO aficionados will appreciate exactly how detailed the model is. While the build is still relatively easy (making it perfect even for less-experienced builders, it comes with all the trims, including an 8 cylinder engine, an abundance of afterburners (there’s a pretty impressive rotating afterburner on the back, along with smaller static ones on the roof and the hood) complete with blue flame bricks, and those light bricks, which are activated by a lever. The crime-fighting car’s dashboard is just as maxed out as the car, with one of the most detailed panels you’ll ever see. It isn’t often that LEGO gives you a peek into the interiors of its cars – this is one of those times when LEGO proudly wants to showcase exactly how immaculate its build is.",
            "The images below come from a review on Rebrickable which details the entire process step-by-step. The entire car can be completed in 6 broad stages, starting from the fairly detailed engine block and then building outwards finally to the car’s fairing and the extraneous elements like the wheels. The car, once complete, has a pretty aggressive front-leaning stance. While most LEGO builders often get caught up in the joy of building out their kits, the Batmobile is actually a lot of fun to play with even after you’ve assembled it. The hoods and doors open to reveal the car’s inner workings, and perhaps my favorite features remain the fact that the rear afterburner rotates and the V8 engine’s pistons actually move up and down while the car is in motion! That is, aside from the Batmobile’s piece-de-resistance – the two light bricks that illuminate to cast a menacing red glow that’s truly emblematic of Master Wayne’s aggressive vigilante alter-ego!",

            "The Batman playing out in theatres is taking the crime-fighting vigilante lovers by the storm. Even more so the Batmobile that Bruce builds in his garage. Director Matt Reeves and production designer James Chinlund took a whole chunk of time deciding the final design of the Batmobile which gets the 69 Dodge Charger as its base. Finally comes out the juggernaut ride loaded with a Tesla drivetrain to make possible the intimidating breathing and blue flame-spitting effect under the hood in the dark of the night. When in the movie the Batmobile starts for the first time in the dark alley, the blue flames glow from within and the headlights come on.",
            "Designer: Ash Thorp",
            "But where did the core design of the car sprout from before it turned into this real-life crime-fighting machine? Matt commissioned digital artist Ash Thorp to create the vision of the Batmobile to be featured in the rollercoaster movie. There were very slight changes in the final modified muscle car-like machine Bruce drives around in the action-packed scenes, but this is the actual creation that we see in the blockbuster movie.",
            "The Batmobile is invincible with its massive steel front bumper designed to ram anything that comes in its path. That huge engine exposed at the rear is the true reflection of the car’s offensive personality – chasing down every bad soul in town. According to Chinlund the muscular beast gets a matching Chevy V8 627 horsepower engine to give it the ultimate kick in adrenaline-induing sequences. To top it off the ride is super agile as it jumps off the ramps, ride on two wheels, and also do burnouts!",
            "Now that the movie is there for all to see Ash Thorp has finally released the original renders of the Batmobile he sent to Reeves. Being comic buff and a die-hard Batman fan himself right since childhood, this was the perfect opportunity for Ash to showcase his design skills, and boy did he do a stellar job. It’s such a high seeing this concept Batmobile come to life and convey a deeper story!"

            "While driving at good speeds down the city road you need to stop for the red light, the cranky feeling of motion inside the car when the brakes are hit is not very pleasant. The passengers tilt abruptly forward and then backward as the vehicle comes to a standstill. Nissan wants to get over this irk of driving with their e-4ORCE twin motor all-wheel control technology to smoothly manage the braking performance. The tech is all set to debut in the 2023 Ariya electric crossover later this year, but for now, the Japanese automotive giant wants to show off this technology in its unique style.",

            "To demonstrate the level of comfort passengers and the driver will experience while braking, they’ve created an all-electric ramen robot server tray on wheels. Yes, the lip-smacking Japanese noodles served in a bowl are loaded on the miniature drivetrain with the tray on top, replicating the Ariya’s chassis. In the entertaining video released by Nissan, the motorized custom-built server tray delivers the hot bowl of ramen noodles to eager Japanese foodies sitting at the counter. Watch as the chef pours the delicacy into the bowl and places it on top of the tray which then smoothly rides on the countertop.",
            "The absolute smoothness and stability of the technology ensure not even a single drop of the tasty staple is spilled. That’s exactly how the Ariya is going to come to a standstill under braking. According to Ryozo Hiraku, expert leader of Nissan’s powertrain and EV engineering division, the regenerative braking is managed on each of the axles to drastically reduce the pinch and dive. He added; “by taking advantage of e-4ORCE’s precise motor control response, we’re able to control vehicle motion as soon as the brakes are applied, giving all occupants – especially passengers – a stable, smooth ride.”",
            "Nissan Ariya is currently up for reservation in the US at a starting price tag of $45,950 for the single motor trim. The AWD system-equipped version dubbed Platinum+ e-4ORCE will sell for $58,950."

            "Every city has its woes with public transportation. With its debut in the United States going back as far as 1895, the underground subway system has defined rapid transit for decades. As increasing rates of densification and urbanization morph the face of our cities, our public transportation must accommodate the larger crowds and higher demands.",
            "Designer: Atelier Schall, Doppelmayr France, Île-de-France Mobilités, Spie Batignolles, and Egis Rail.",
            "Moving from the underground to the high heavens, the city of Paris finds promise in an airborne mode of transit. Aimed for completion by 2025, the new transit system is called the Cable A Gondola, an electric-powered gondola line that will connect the suburb of Villeneuve-Saint-Georges with the Créteil Pointe du Lac station on Paris’ Metro line 8.",
            "As cities find new ways to provide sufficient public transportation to larger crowds, the issue of sustainability arises. As gondolas prove to be inexpensive and eco-conscious players in the public transportation game, more and more cities are integrating them into their urban fabric. Following their proposal for a new 4.5km gondola line, the French city will pay $149 million to connect 11,000 passengers to Paris’s metro system and Créteil on a daily basis.",
            "Connecting the hilly residential avenues of Créteil to Paris’s cityscape, gondolas are able to connect hard-to-reach areas that previous modes of transit could not. Since many are electric, gondolas are also quiet by design and do not produce much pollution during operation.",
            "Gondolas also indicate an inexpensive alternative to other urban infrastructures like bridges, railways, and tunnels. Considering the gondola’s many advantages, the new Paris proposal would function primarily as a transportation filler. Parisian suburbs will have a direct line to the city’s metro system in a way that was previously unprecedented.",
            "In a city like Paris, the approval of the gondola proposal signals a new dawn for public transportation. As Brent Toderian, chief city planner of Vancouver from 2006 to 2012, describes, “In recent years, the conversation has moved from gondolas being a kind of novelty to a conversation where they’re being considered as a logical and viable transit technology.”"

            "One first look this revolutionary bicycle seems like the ride of a future world, too ahead of its time for the current era to even think of hopping on to. But then it proves us all wrong with the mechanics working behind to make it possible. An all-wheel-drive system and a construction element – wherein the whole bike is a modern marvel of engineering.",
            "Created by Stuttgart-based designer Stephan Henrich, the uniquely shaped bicycle is an out-of-the-box automotive design by a long way. The all-wheel beach and city cruiser is propelled forward by a monotyre-clip chain system which automatically forms a temporary rim in the wheel sections, as well as a dented belt drive in the interior groove. The monotyre is powered via the central wheel as the crank generates the force required to churn the wheels. The bicycle sets into motion with the help of the short-chain, and an 8-speed gearbox which is nothing like we have seen thus far.",
            "Designer: Stephan Henrich",
            "The name infinity is obviously derived from the shape of the bicycle which in fact is perfect for a sci-fi flick plot. Independent suspension systems on the front and the rear provide the ride with enough dampening to take on the rugged and uneven roads. It’s more like a hubless bike concept that keeps intriguing us from time to time. That said, seeing it on a bicycle is an altogether different ball game – as the Infinity impresses with the one construction element that fluidly changes between functions.",
            "Stephan strongly believes the all-wheel-drive bicycle design here has great potential to shake up the market. Given the requisite funds and strategic partners for manufacturing can give able support, the ride could soon take shape from a concept to a prototype, and then to a commercially viable product for the masses."

            "The wind in your hair, a cinematic birds-eye shot of you in the car, ‘Can We Skip To The Good Part’ playing in the background, millions of likes on TikTok. That’s pretty much the core design brief of Polestar’s new electric vehicle, the O2, which comes with its own autonomous drone that can film you as you drive down an empty highway.",
            "The prime objective of a car, for as long as cars have existed, has been to get you safely and speedily from point A. to B. One could argue that my previous sentence may be a bit of an oversimplification, although even something as niche as a racing car does just that – takes you from A to B while keeping the rider safe. Sure, there are a few outliers, some cars are designed to put you in the lap of luxury, other cars are status symbols, some cars/automobiles have more niche functions (tractors, steamrollers, etc.), and some concept cars exist only to showcase a company’s innovative spirit… however, almost every commonplace car’s main objective has been transportation… up until now.",
            "The Polestar O2 capitalizes on a rising trend that’s been set by self-driving cars. Sure, the O2 isn’t a self-driving concept, but just the way self-driving cars have redefined what sitting inside an automobile means (you’re not a passenger anymore – you’re a traveler in a moving room), the O2 has shifted the focus from driving to ‘enjoying driving’. The Polestar O2, announced just today, isn’t your average EV… it’s an EV that wants you to be in the driver’s seat as well as the director’s seat. The car comes with a companion drone stashed in its boot that deploys on command, filming you from flattering angles so that you’re quite literally the star of your own Fast and Furious film. Is it sensible? It may be too soon to say. Is it intriguing? Overwhelmingly.",
            "Designer: Polestar",
            "The O2 is quite like Polestar’s Precept from back in 2020. It’s clearly announced as a concept car with no foreseeable future of being manufactured. The Volvo-owned company does, however, want to use this opportunity to drum up excitement for EVs and bring a new dimension of thrill to riding a car (Ford launched a gasoline-scented perfume to that very end last year). Having a drone following you around as you drive has its own appeal – it’s a wonderful cinematographic tool that really brings a new meaning to a car’s ‘performance’, while at the same time providing a nifty new trick for people who want to see what a videogame-style ‘third-person view’ would actually look like while driving.",
            "The car sports Polestar’s signature edgy-yet-friendly language (automotive brutalism, if you will) and is based on a bespoke aluminum platform that’s adapted from the one developed for the upcoming Polestar 5 automobile. There’s really no word on what the car’s specs are, understandable given its conceptual nature, however, Polestar’s retained its old practice of focusing on sustainability with the O2. The car’s seats are made from a fabric woven using recycled polyester, and different grades of aluminum used throughout the chassis are meticulously labeled to make them easier to segregate during recycling.",
            "Now onto the car’s standout feature – that autonomous cameraman that sits in its boot. The rear of the O2 houses a ‘cinematic’ drone developed in collaboration with Hoco Flow that can be deployed even while the car’s in motion. This aforementioned drone can follow your car at speeds of up to 56mph and has multiple flight modes to choose from, including a certain ‘atmospheric’ mode that’s perfect for when you’ve got the top down and a scenic open road ahead. Footage recorded on the drone can then be viewed and edited on the O2’s massive infotainment display, unlocking an incredibly exciting new realm of possibilities for passionate drivers, content creators, and even influencers. Cinematic Carpool Karaoke a la Polestar O2? Well, I’d certainly love to see that happen…"

Afros, floral tees, the Peace sign, bell-bottoms, and the Microbus were practically synonymous with the entire decade, and 40 years later, at least one of those things is making a grand comeback. Unveiled today at a virtual event and scheduled for a 2024 launch, the Volkswagen ID Buzz is a modern remake of its cult-classic Type 2 Microbus, with a few key design upgrades, and an electric drivetrain (they should have just rebranded to Voltswagen).",
            "Designer: Volkswagen",
            "The car’s been teased for years at this point, but only landed an official announcement today against a somber backdrop of the war in Ukraine – an event that holds major ramifications for VW’s country of Germany. The event was hosted in Hamburg, at Schuppen 52 – a port of great significance not just because of its past (VW shipped thousands of Microbuses around the world on these very ports) but also because of its present, where the ports are now entirely powered by solar energy, a hat-tip to the ID Buzz’s new green and clean powertrain.",
            "On the design front, the Volkswagen ID Buzz is the perfect tribute to its iconic ancestor, with virtually the same silhouette and even the same split-color design and colorways (you’re looking at the iconic Day-Glo lemon yellow and white color scheme) as its 40-year-old predecessor. One could argue that this split color design practically MADE the Microbus a cultural icon, and retaining that is VW’s way of owning its legacy. However, its buggish, cute, curious-eyed appeal has gone, only to be replaced by headlights that are much more discerning and modern-looking. One could justifiably argue that the Microbus has evolved, like a Pokémon, with a serious demeanor that shows a hint of maturity along with its playful curiosity.",

The race to electrify vehicles has seen cars, bikes, SUVs, pickup trucks, and even semi tricks get fresh electric powertrains, although the minivan remains one of the last few categories to see this sort of refresh (another notable example is the Canoo Minivan). The Volkswagen ID Buzz serves as a showcase for the company’s MEB modular electric architecture, and sports an 81kWh battery pack built right in. The battery powers a rear-axle motor that’s capable of 201 horsepower and 229 lb-feet of torque, although given the size and nature of the ID Buzz (it is a family car after all), don’t expect it to break any speed records. VW is limiting the van’s top speed to just 90 mph (145 km/h), which might sound low to the average driver, but makes sense considering how hulking the vehicle actually is.",
            "The standard wheelbase of the ID Buzz comes with 5 seats, although there’s a 6-seater option underway. The interiors of the ID Buzz are incredibly spacious, and all seats are individually adjustable, with the rear seats having the option to fold down to give you much more boot space. VW, however, plans on launching an extended wheelbase version of the ID Buzz in the USA, with a 7-seater capacity, arranged in a 2-3-2 layout.",
            "The rollout for the ID Buzz will span over the next two years. The car will be available in 2 wheelbases as well as 2 variants – the ID Buzz and the ID Cargo. The standard wheelbase variant will ideally launch at the end of this year in Europe, with the extended wheelbase version debuting in 2023. USA, however, will see the ID Buzz reach its doors between the years 2023 and 2024. Volkswagen is yet to reveal pricing for the automobile."

            "There is a great deal of fuss over all-electric vehicles today, but most of those have been focused on vehicles with wheels rolling on land. Electric aircraft is still in the age of their infancy, and you barely even hear about aquatic modes of travel switching to more sustainable sources of power. There are, of course, attempts at designing electric boats and jet skis, but the upcoming Supermarine MM01 might be the most ambitious one of all, both in handsome looks and in luxurious price.",
            "Designers: Germain and Léopold Bouvet",
            "Jet skis aren’t exactly your typical mode of transportation over water. They’re good for crossing short distances, hopping from island to island, but they’re often associated more with sports and sometimes dangerous thrills where speed is the name of the game. It isn’t by accident, then, that this Supermarine MM01 by Bouvet Frères Marine is being branded as a hyper jet ski in line with hypercars on land.",
            "The futuristic-looking aquatic vehicle will be powered by a 300hp electric motor generating 220kw of power. In theory, this would allow the jet ski to blast through waters at a top speed of 75 mph, and the company advertises an “autonomy” of 2 hours tops. It’s powered by electricity rather than fuel, of course, which almost makes it sound like a more sustainable option. But if you thought electric vehicles were more expensive than their gasoline-chugging counterparts, then the Supermarine MM01 easily outclasses those by a nautical mile.",
            "This “hyper jet ski” is ultimately a luxury vehicle if its appearance wasn’t already a dead giveaway. It’s a sporty vehicle, as its rip-roaring specs suggest, but it’s also described as a “lifestyle machine” designed with ergonomics and style in mind. Leather upholstered front trunk, a touch screen for navigation, and a carbon Kevlar monocoque frame all point to something that’s designed for more affluent customers. There’s even a dedicated champagne holder under the two-seater saddle if you still have any doubts.",
            "Interestingly, the form of the Supermarine MM01 seems to take its cue not from luxury cars but futuristic hovercrafts. Although its speed hopefully won’t make you fly out of the water, the jet ski’s aerodynamic design is more similar to sci-fi flying vehicles than your typical water speedsters. And if you add wheels, it wouldn’t look out of place over land either. Coincidentally, its designers have earned their reputation building cars, which is why you can get some amphibious vibes from this electric jet ski.",
            "Perhaps the biggest telltale sign of this vehicle’s luxury DNA is in the number of jet skis that the company will produce. Only 30 Supermarine MM01’s will be made, at least in its first run, split between white “Mother of Pearl” and black edition colors. The designers are well aware that these luxury machines will have a high asking price, but they aren’t as concerned about profitability as they are in creating something that symbolizes a passion for aesthetics and creative freedom."

Either the bike’s upper body is bigger than the set of wheels it has got (very biased on the part of the designer I believe), or the ride was deliberately created to garner attention. It seems, the front section somehow got offset during the blueprint stage, and no one even bothered to point that out. Even the handlebar has a disproportionate geometry, so the mini bike for sure has that disproportional theme running in its DNA. Either way, it has a peculiar cute element to it. Most certainly it takes a detour from the industry-proven design language of balanced proportions and smooth flowing lines.",
            "The Martiniceu Racing livery suggests its high-speed character, but the designer doesn’t mention any of the specifications here. The exposed side body of the bike clearly indicates the mini bike is powered by fuel and not an electric battery, as most automotive designers choose to do so in the current era. The bloated form factor is revealing of its short commute character, and in no way can it take to the racing tracks, not even mildly in my view.",

            "The Tatra 77 Homage, however, brings a few upgrades to the nearly 90-year old automobile’s design. For starters, it comes with an electric drivetrain whose workings are made even more efficient by the car’s unbelievably streamlined body. If the original was designed by a zeppelin-maker, it’s not difficult to see that inspiration in the new Tatra 77’s design either, with its curved, bulbous front. In fact, the car’s silhouette is entirely comprised of beautifully aerodynamic lines that make it look like someone turned those smoke lines in a wind-tunnel-test into an actual automobile!",
            "Designer: Radek Štěpán",
            "The redesign for the Tatra 77 comes from the mind of Radek Štěpán, an automotive designer based out of Prague. Wanting to revisit one of the most iconic cars in his country’s history, Štěpán decided to redesign the Tatra 77 as if it were produced today. What started as a harmless exercise in 2020’s lockdown blossomed into an incredibly sleek and desirable car with a strong and memorable visual language, and some stunning details!",
            "Aside from being an aerodynamic wonder, the Tatra 77 Homage really pays tribute to its ancestor, with the silver paint job as well as the circular element in the center, where the original car had its third headlight. This circular cutout, now, acts as the branding for the car, while the other two circular cutouts (sliced into semi-circles) become the car’s pop-out headlights, along with the slicing LED strip running along the front of the car. On the rear, the car sports yet another LED strip which becomes its taillight.",
            "The way the Tatra 77 Homage deals with surfaces is sheer artistry. The car knows when to be curvy and when to have sharp edges, giving it an overall definition that’s instantly eye-catching. Every glass surface sits absolutely flush against the car’s body, with not so much as a slight depression or a visible parting line in sight. In fact, all the parting lines are crisp and thin, while details like the handlebars sit flush against the car’s body too. In fact, the only details emerging from the car’s design are the three cameras, two on each side of the vehicle (where you’d expect side mirrors), and one on the roof, right at the end, giving the rider a detailed rear-view of the road."

            "Microplastics are the most common source of plastic pollution wreaking havoc on planet earth. The nature of microplastics is such that they are hard to detect for the naked eye, and have tormented marine life beyond belief. The toxic nature of this material has disrupted the food chain, and is also suspected to trigger a number of ailments in humans and other land animals and birds. So, common logic suggests, we should do anything and everything possible to suppress this nemesis.",
            "A recent study found that airborne microplastic pollution is turning into a major contributor, and vehicle tires are to blame for that majorly. Andreas Stohl, from the Norwegian Institute for Air Research, said that an average tire loses 4kg during its lifetime. To top it off, the electric vehicle revolution is making things worse. Such vehicles are much heavier than their internal combustion engine counterparts, leading to more tire and brake pad wear. The solution is to design a tire in such a way that it doesn’t emit any microplastics into the environment. Unless tires are made out of some other revolutionary material, the only other way to prevent the dire situation is by collecting the microplastics in the tire itself.",
            "Designer: Cheolhee Lee, Seongjong Kang and Lee JH96",
            "Pureback Nexen Tire is a concept envisioning the prevention of air pollution primarily caused by tire wear. The eco-friendly tire separates and discharges the microplastics while driving. The harmful airborne plastic not visible to the naked eye is pushed through the inlet between the tire treads where the hazardous material is stored in the central capsule. The sides of the tire are made out of steel to create safe housing for the collected material. Designers suggest that the collected microplastics will be compressed and deposited at hydrogen charging stations by connecting to the hydrogenation system. The users will consequently be eligible for corresponding rewards and benefits. Logically, this radically designed tire is good in functionality, solving a serious problem for us all, while also being aesthetically pleasing to look at.",
            "The grooves of the Pureback tire and the wheel cover housing have a connected LED lighting system on the side walls. When the tire is collecting microplastics it illuminates in blue color, and as soon as the collection capsule is reaching the full limit, it turns red. This indicates the time to deposit the toxic material at the next hydrogen filling station."

            "An iconic set of wheels in its own rights, this Mercedes was ahead of its time in terms of automotive design, and that swag factor. No doubt it was the dream car for many enthusiasts and collectors alike who would literally dry out their fat bank accounts to park one in their garage back in those times. Khyzyl Saleem has managed to capture the nostalgic spirit of the original EVO2 while infusing a refreshing swanky aura. The original body lines of the Merc have been maintained, and at the same time modernizing the overall flow.

Boy, that side profile silver with the mint green on the decals, pillars, roof and rear wing; matched contrastingly to the matte black on the front section is a makeover a hotshot Nike sneaker would be proud of. The wheels get the street racing treatment with fat volume and rims that are absolutely sick. Up front, the halogen lights have been replaced with mean LED lights adding more character to this ride.",

            "The CanguRo Mobility Robot is a classic example of building the future by looking at the past. For centuries (if not millennia), humans have rode on horses as transport. The horse, unlike a car or motorcycle, forms a relationship with the rider over time, following, responding to commands, and remaining subservient to its owner. The CanguRo Mobility Robot provides a similar experience with a three-wheeled robot that the user can ride, summon via their smartphone, and even walk ahead of as the robot follows them along. The three-wheeled mobility bot is autonomous, which gives the rider a certain degree of freedom. It can be summoned from the parking lot by simply tapping a button, and can even follow you around as you walk. However, when you want to ride it, straddle yourself in its seat and the three wheels spread apart, providing you with a comfortable, controlled, and stable driving experience!",
            "The Board is an award-winning collapsible skateboard that is inspired by the same mechanical linkage system seen in collapsing gates, in scissors, and in those expandable grabber toys you’re probably familiar with. It’s hard to think of how skateboards and gates have any design-process overlap, but The Board makes it clear that a detail found in one product can easily and effectively be ported onto another product with stunning results. The Board uses this collapsible linkage system to make itself more portable. Machined metal components are arranged, sandwiched, and connected to each other with multiple pivot points to make The Board’s body. These linkages allow The Board to expand and collapse just by pulling or pushing it, taking it from a long, skateboard shape to a much more compact and carryable circular shape that easily fits right into backpacks. The metal construction gives The Board its signature strength (so the pieces don’t bend or flex when you stand on the skateboard), while also imparting a unique appearance to it, whether open or closed!",

The Sadler Folding Electric Bike, as its name suggests, comes with an electric powertrain that takes the effort out of manually cycling. Aside from that, it comes with a folding frame that’s also made further innovative by the two hubless wheels on the bicycle, and the frame’s carbon fiber construction. The foldable and portable design allows the Sadler to measure a mere 26-inches when closed, making it the world’s most compact folding e-bike. Designed and manufactured in Italy, the Sadler comes in three versions – a classic manual bike, a 3-gear shift, and the electrified version.",
            "Although the Cerberus has the stylings of a café racer, it is, in fact, a moped owing to its lean lithe frame with the hollow design right under what looks like the moped’s fuel tank. The Cerberus sports one of the most interesting hybrid power systems. It comes equipped with a 2.3kw 50cc 4 stroke engine powered by a 2.8 kW electric battery and even has that aforementioned fuel tank to power the engine. If those weren’t enough, the Cerberus also has, wait for it, a set of foot pedals that allow it to live up to its moped name (the ped in moped standing for pedal)!

            "As incredibly wicked as the Wusa electric scooter looks, it is, in fact, designed to help people with reduced mobility make their way around. The brief of the Wusa is a pretty interesting one – envisioned for Japan, a country that’s seeing a gradual reduction in its population along with an increase in the median age of its citizens, the Wusa hopes to provide a robust, reliable personal mobility solution for people who often opt for public transport but are seeing these options close down due to a reduction in population and in demand. The scooter/motorcycle is a pretty nifty-looking electric two-wheeler that not only lets you ride it around from point A to B, it also comes with the ability to strap a wheelchair to its rear, turning it effectively into a motor-powered trike. The beauty of the Wusa, mentions designer Anri Sugihara, is that it’s agnostic in its approach to the rider. “This compact mobility won’t separate user by their body ability”, Sugihara says. “It can be enjoyed by both manual wheelchair users and able-bodied people for their own usage.” By doing so, it elevates the status and position of a ‘welfare vehicle’, truly impacting all its consumers by being as inclusive as possible.",

            "With a range of 1000 kilometers, and an aesthetic that sort of looks like an Apple Magic Mouse with wheels and headlights, the Fresco XL comes from a Norwegian startup that claims its EV’s extra-large battery allows it to drive from Paris to Amsterdam… and back.",
            "Exceeding even Lucid Air’s bonkers EV range of 837km, the Fresco XL boasts a 1000 kilometer (621 mile) driving range on a full battery. This, the Norwegian startup mentions, comes thanks to its unique aerodynamic design, and the massive battery pack located within the car’s platform.",
            "The suffix XL in Fresco XL comes from the fact that even though the car looks like a compact minivan, it is, in fact, an 8-seater sedan, designed to perform as an all-weather, off-roader too. Is it trying to disrupt the sedan category the way the Tesla Cybertruck disrupted the pickup-truck category? Well, probably. The car looks more like an abstraction of a Daft Punk helmet than an automobile, and sports absolutely no branding on it aside from the minimal Fresco logo embossed on the front and back. In fact, the logo isn’t even visible until you see it against angled light. The purpose, one could assume, is to ensure the design of the car does the talking. Its minimalist aesthetic is, by all means, bold and expressive, and if you saw that car on the road today, there’s no way you wouldn’t give it a second glance.",
            "The car uses a stacked battery system that connects directly to a dual-motor layout, with a motor on each axle. The dual-motor system gives the vehicle much more control on icy roads, a condition that seems more catered to the Norwegian startup’s home audience. Its massive design also allows you to fold down the rear seats and turn the inside into a mini camper – perfect for long road trips, something that the Fresco XL’s battery definitely permits. Speaking of its highly capable battery, Fresco Motors even mentions that you can hook the car up to your house and use your car battery as a backup power source for when the lights go out. Pretty neat, eh? The only thing I hate about the car is how terrible those images look. Hey Fresco, maybe next time also share some hi-resolution shots so we don’t have to screen-grab images from a 1080p YouTube video.",
            "The designers of the EV are pretty adamant about calling the Fresco XL a ‘pod’ and not a car. It has a lot to do with the design, I assume. The EV pod’s design is an absolute deviation from any current automotive stylings. Its headlight and taillight are a steely emotionless light-strip, as are the car’s wheels which come with flat rims to make the vehicle look like even more of an enigma. Side mirrors? Nope. Door handles? How about no. Even the windows and front and rear windshields are tinted black, making the car (sorry, pod) look like an absolute mystery.",
            "The Fresco XL is undoubtedly a great car on paper, but enthusiasts should take its design with a massive grain of salt. Just like the Cybertruck is going through major reiterations to make it production-ready and road-legal, the Fresco XL will probably see its fair set of design changes before the car actually hits the road. In fact, the Fresco Motors company profile on LinkedIn only shows 6 employees, which does raise a few concerns. However, if you’re incredibly enthusiastic, Fresco Motors IS accepting pre-orders on its website, with the car’s final price being a pretty hefty $114,330. If you happened to have that kind of money to throw away, you’re better off buying a Bored Ape instead.",

The Maven e-trike is for a single user. But since each user is unique in terms of size and body measurement, the vehicle can adjust to the rider’s size.",
            "The urban e-trike works this way: scan, adjust, and return to a node autonomously. The Maven scans the rider and take his body measurement. It then unfolds to the rider’s size for a comfortable fit and ride. The e-trike is designed for use on most bike paths and pedestrian spaces so exploring a city can be convenient. No need to go through regular traffic as this thing doesn’t take much space. In concept, the vehicle can autonomously return to its node.",
            "It’s a solution that must be considered by local governments in the near future. It can be a city-wide project as the platform requires different nodes and hubs to be accessible and widely positioned across the city.",

The result is a concept product that goes beyond aesthetics. Its customization makes it a sustainable choice and we believe the long-term benefits can be guaranteed for society as a whole.",
            "Concept development began with early sketches of functions and the form of the package. Early concepts appeared to be sculptural for a personal vehicle but eventually, the designer came up with his desired technical feel. 3D renders helped a lot in offering a more refined design with more accurate measurements and proportions.",
            "The concept vehicle is an e-trike. With the three wheels, one at the rear and two in front, the rider can be more at ease with the stability it offers compared to a bike. In some angles, it looks like a futuristic baby pram with its TRON-style design—plain and dark colors with sleek bright lines in LED. When unfolded, some may probably think it is one heavy vacuum cleaner or a new Segway.",
            "The Maven e-trike takes less space, especially at rest. You can drag it when not in use or when you want to walk for a bit. To open the vehicle, simply lift the handlebars. It will open now to a riding position. There are two pegs underneath for leg support. The handlebars can be raised for steering the e-trike. Brakes and throttle are controlled by built-in triggers in the handlebar. At the front, there is a basket are where you can place your stuff."

            "A modern solution for a modern problem, the Orbit is a mass-transit system designed to provide public transport for people with agoraphobia. The pandemic has drawn major attention to the need to socially distance, although people with agoraphobia find it difficult to be around other people, to begin with. Orbit aims to hit two birds with one stone, providing a public transport system that’s accommodating for all, while still creating a private, personalized travel experience. The larger vehicle acts as a ‘movable nest’ for smaller pods that can independently dislodge from the main body of the Orbit and complete last-mile pickups and drop-offs for people. The main vehicle covers fixed frequent routes while the individual pods provide access in remote areas, picking them up from their locations and taking them to the main vehicle, which transports everyone in their own enclosed bubble!",

            "The Indian Railways is among one of the world’s largest rail networks, although 41% of its accidents and 63% of its fatalities happen OUTSIDE the train, on railway crossings. Kiran Babu’s Concept Holosafe aims at making the railway crossing not only safer but much more informative too. There’s a sense of complacency when you see the barricade descend at a railway crossing, and most people simply assume that they’ve got a reasonable window of time to cross before the train ACTUALLY arrives because the barricade doesn’t tell you how long you have to wait. This attitude is so prevalent at unmanned crossings in India that the government has decided to completely close off all unmanned crossings in the interest of public safety. Kiran Babu’s solution is a novel one that promotes safety by eliminating complacency and replacing it with actionable information. While it isn’t entirely possible to prevent people from crossing over at unmanned railway crossings, Babu’s solution implements a holographic counter that acts as a ‘traffic light’ of sorts. The holographic barricade creates a virtual ‘red zone’ with a countdown clock to let people know how long they’ll be waiting at the crossing, and when the train passes by, it turns into a green zone with a countdown clock too, giving people a realistic idea of the time they’ve got before the zone turns red again. Sounds a lot like a certain Squid Game event, but hey… this one’s actually designed to SAVE lives!",

            "When Elon took to the stage to reveal the Cybertruck design, he made a pretty telling and significant observation – when you put the top pickup trucks right beside each other and remove their branding, it’s difficult to tell them apart. That statement ushered in a new age of pickup truck design, with Tesla, Rivian, Canoo, and a bunch of other automotive companies redefining what a new-age electric pickup truck should look like. With this new pickup concept, it seems like Jeep is throwing its hat into the ring too.",
            "The Jeep Pickup Concept by Aitor Amigo López is a balanced fusion of modern yet traditionally brawny… a combination of beastly and refined – sort of like ‘Smart Hulk’. I wouldn’t imagine a lumberjack or trucker behind the wheel of this car… but swap out their flannel shirt and dungarees for a leather jacket and sunglasses and maybe they’d fit right into this modern monster.",
            "Designer: Aitor Amigo López",
            "When López envisioned his concept, he undoubtedly flashed his creative license quite a bit. Purely from a realism standard, there are a few things that feel ‘far-fetched’ about this concept, although on paper, the Jeep Pickup is purely a ‘what if’ exercise, so it’s best viewed from that lens.",
            "The Jeep Pickup sports the same low-poly edgy design as the Cybertruck, although it isn’t shy to explore curves, complex 3D surfaces, and an overall aesthetic that’s more expressive than Cybertruck’s bare-basics minimal design. The concept makes use of both sheet metal as well as carbon-fiber, creating a dual-color effect around the front, sides, and back that’s definitely interesting to look at. The mammoth of a vehicle floats majestically off the floor with ground clearance that’s enough to let you drive over boulders without worrying about them hitting the underside of your car. This concept may look like it was designed to have an electric powertrain under the hood, although grilles on the front of the car make me wonder otherwise.",
            "Now onto the more ‘unrealistic’ details on the Jeep Pickup. For starters, the car doesn’t sport any glass panels. The front and rear windshield are made from a pretty futuristic-looking hexagonal armor-panel (I’m getting Crysis vibes), while the side windows are decidedly opaque. One could assume that the interior of the car’s equipped with massive HUDs and display panels (sort of like the inside of a tank)… given the impression the Jeep Pickup is trying to make, that seems like a pretty fitting design direction. The opaque panels, sadly, mean that there’s no way to see what the insides of the pickup look like. Maybe the designer will detail it out sometime in the future.",
            "Speaking of ‘future’, the car’s modern aesthetic is further completed thanks to its edge-lit headlight and taillight, the lack of side mirrors, and even door handles. The truck does, however, come with a pretty spacious rear bed. Big enough for a quad-bike… or maybe a hovercraft if we’re this far into the future?"

Singer Vehicle Design has aced car remodeling, setting precedence for automotive ateliers across the globe. Now, their reimagined classic Porsche Turbo 911 is giving automotive enthusiasts a peek of what the four-wheeler was missing all these years.",
            "The California-based company ventured out on creating the Turbo Study after overwhelming requests to create the spicier variant of the restored Porsche 911 supercar. The founder and Executive Charmain, Rob Dickinson, wanted to capture the essence of Porsche’s first-ever supercar. There’s a personal connection to this, since, Rob took a ride of the Porsche 911 in 1976 when he was 11-years old. It left him star-struck, to be inside this machine draped in red tartan seats. Now, after all these decades, the Singer Turbo Study gets the bespoke carbon fiber body (using modern composite construction method) ditching the classic metal structure. This results in a lighter 911 Turbo which is better to handle and accelerates way better than the original.",
            "Designer: Singer Vehicle Design",
            "The Turbo Study wearing the Wolf Blue skin is more on the touring vehicle genre thanks to the rear-wheel drive and suspension tuning. There’s the option of all-wheel-drive, and either way it gets a six-speed manual gearbox. The engine on this one is a 3.8-liter twin-turbocharged one with bespoke air-to-water intercoolers, found inside the inlet plenums. The car churns out 450 horsepower, and the owners can enhance that value further with customization. The functionality, luxury and comfort take precedence here with inclusions like rear wiper, electrically heated seats, air conditioning, cruise control, integrated wireless charger, and navigation system.",
            "For premium styling, the Whale Tail is now bigger and with bigger vents, while the bumpers get a revamp without giving away the cushioning items of the original. The car based on the 964-generation 911 has more modern dual exhausts in a very neat design language, hips are more profound, and the panel grips are a lot tighter. Wheels also get the 18-inch size revamp in the form of Fuch-styling, and are wider than the classic. On the inside it is a treat to ride in – those Malibu Sand Leather covering and the Black Forest wood trim on the dashboard and door panels are proof enough.",
            "Already 70 reservations of the Turbo Study have been booked and it will show up at the 2022 Goodwood Festival of Speed in West Sussex, England, from June 23 through 26. The pricing of this eye-candy Porsche is still not known, but going by the past trend this Turbo could easily touch $1 million. Of course, the level of customization might take even higher."

That doesn’t mean you can’t find other ways to express that idea of speed in other ways, from colors to decals. And if you’re going to express speed with something that will really turn heads, you might as well do it in one of the most expressive media available: comic books.",
            "Designer: Jeff Koons",
            "Comic books have experienced a renaissance period in the past decade or so, partly thanks to the almost maddening number of films and TV shows made around them during that period. While there will be many who will remain unfamiliar with the characters from Marvel’s and DC’s fictional universe, almost everyone is familiar with the sequential art of comics, or at least the visual idioms used in the medium.",
            "That familiarity and popularity is perhaps what inspired famed artist Jeff Koons’ to take a stab at mixing comics and cars to convey that idea of speed. Not that the 2023 BMW M850i Gran Coupe needs any help in sending that message, especially when it’s already burning rubber. This special collaboration, however, is almost just as over the top as popular comics are in getting the message across, combining specially chosen lines, colors, iconography, and even sound effects in words.",
            "On the outside, you are treated to a sea of blue broken by patches of yellow on the front and back. Koons chose the color to give the impression of space where a speedster would be traveling at the speed of light, or something like that. The car’s sides are decorated with white bursts, a poof, and a loud POP!, common devices used in comics to denote an explosion of action and speed. And if that weren’t enough, the BMW 8’s trunk depicts a really big bang, almost reminiscent of the 60s Batmobile’s exhaust.",
            "The interior colors contrast sharply with the ones outside and have a stronger superhero vibe. The alternating blue and red might immediately bring to mind those characters that embraced the same motif, from Superman to Spider-Man to Wonder Woman. Sitting inside might make you feel like such a superhero rolling into action, traveling at speeds most mortals can’t even experience.",
            "That said, most mortals probably won’t even be able to experience this 8 x Jeff Koons collab. Just like a limited edition comic book, this specially-designed comic book car will be “printed” only 99 times and will fetch a six-digit price tag when it finally rolls out."

            "Personal mobility vehicles have become more trendy in the past years, especially with the introduction of electric scooters and bikes. Traditional fuel engine motorcycles and scooters, however, are still the most dominant types of transportation under this category. While their effects on the environment during use are already well-known, the negative impact that they have during the manufacturing process is less so. One Swedish company is trying to change all that by having a robot that practically folds steel as if it were paper.",
            "Designer: Tue Beijer",
            "The conventional manufacturing process for scooters, both fuel and electric, involve a lot of parts and a lot of wasted materials. The most common structure involves a plastic body that’s attached on top of a tubular metal frame. This doesn’t have to be the case, according to Swedish startup Stilride, and they’re trying to prove their point by launching an electric scooter made from what they call “industrial origami.”",
            "Instead of over a hundred separate parts, the Stilride scooter whittles the number down to about 15. The main body of the scooter comes from just a few sheets of steel that are folded by a robotic arm. There are several benefits to this rather innovative process, starting with the reduction of wasted material. The process also takes up less energy, which means fewer fossil fuels burned during the manufacturing of these scooters.",
            "The robots that fold these sheets of steel don’t have to be custom made either and rely more on software rather than hardware to pull off its artistic stunt. This means that existing factories with robot arms can be reused to make this kind of scooter, which translates to fewer factories crowding and polluting the planet. Stilride is even looking into expanding its technology, which it has named Stilfold” to other manufacturing processes as well.",
            "This origami-like structure also benefits even riders of the e-scooters, at least in theory. With fewer parts, each scooter can be lighter but also be structurally stronger. This theory will be put to the test when Stilride launches its first fleet of electric scooters later this year. Looking to the future, the startup wants to switch to even greener materials, like recycled steel, to help protect the environment while helping more people get from point A to point B."

However, the car’s design deserves much more credit than simply serving the role of album art. The car’s gun-metal paint job and wide body kit give it an incredibly bold presence – a presence that’s simply accentuated by the car’s razor-thin ‘I see through your BS’ headlights.",

It retains its retro stylings, however, the car isn’t afraid to show off some unique details, including the inverted hood that also sports four cutouts that let you peer into the belly of the beast. Move your eye a little further to the side and the tires are, in fact, airless (they look a lot like the Michelin ones).",
            "The rear, believe it or not, proves to be more interesting than the front (yes I’m still talking about the Camaro). An oddly placed vent on the top feels highly reminiscent of the engine air intake seen on F1 automobiles… while the area right below the taillight is entirely bare.

            "Merging today’s appeal to sustainable design with autonomous technology, the vehicle’s overall carbon footprint remains low due to the use of recycled and lightweight building materials, re-adaptability, and local power generation. Aguiar goes on to explain that, “this reduces the load on available resources while building, and becoming, a versatile infrastructure to support societal progress.”",

            "From the mind of automotive virtuoso Khyzyl Saleem, the Tesla Muskrat (a name unanimously chosen by Saleem’s IG followers) puts a little meat on the Roadster, making it stand its own against other hypercars like the ones from Czinger, Rimac, Polestar & Evija. The Muskrat builds on the Roadster’s base but with a few key modifications that really bring out the car’s wild side. After all, for a car that’s literally touted to be equipped with rocket thrusters, it should absolutely look the part, no?",
            "The Tesla Muskrat concept takes on a whole new organic approach, combining cues from the Roadster, other hypercars, as well as Saleem’s own creative efforts. The bodywork isn’t shy to showcase its curves, with a white-on-black interplay that brings out the car’s contrast thanks to the massive vents on the hood, and the almost McLaren-inspired headlight cutouts that descend into the air intakes at the base, on either side of the Tesla logo on the front. The front also showcases the Muskrat’s unapologetically eye-catching front bumper with its massive underbite. The bumper extends downwards as well as to the front, creating an unmistakably large lower lip that definitely adds to the hypercar’s silhouette.",
            "The rear of the car seems incredibly interesting too. The taillight’s overall design remains untouched, but the bodywork around it gets Saleem’s signature overhaul. The rear’s a lot wider, and instead of rounding off like it does on the Tesla Roadster, the Muskrat concept has an upward-facing tail, clearly visible on the side profile below. It does a wonderful job of visually balancing out the frontal lip, and parting lines near the C pillar hint at the presence of an automatic spoiler.",

The fully-automated or semi-automated modes will bring in the liberty of cruising at 100 mph on the freeway while sipping a mojito in the driver’s seat. The interior of the Clio VI is divided into two contrasting feels to coincide with the multiple ways in which drivers and passengers can use it to their advantage.",
            "The front has a very solid feeling while the rear radiates a soft and welcoming aura. The positioning of the seats is toggled based on the three different modes – driving mode, working mode or relaxing mode. In the relaxing mode, the front seat completely retracts in a horizontal position to align with the rear seat for a lounger configuration. The central console box is divided into two layers – the top one being a wireless charging compartment and the bottom one for normal storage. The internal airy ambiance is themed around the lights of the city and nature. That justifies the use of materials like grained pattern polyester. Bio-fabric, frosted glass and LEDs. The exterior follows suit in light colors contrasted with the light gray on the bumpers and wheels."

The essence of the design is its Sin City 2077 panache which Roman explicitly highlights in the renderings. For sure it has got to have a Cyberpunk 2077 influence – at least those LED lights and the flowing motifs on the inside lining of the front tires suggest the fact.",

Symmetrical on all sides, the exterior of Polestar is used to represent connectivity and the coming together of humans for a shared interest. Hover blades slide out from the vehicle’s roof to lift Polestar off the ground into the air. Additionally, Park equipped Polestar with progressive technology such as GPS and facial recognition to help modernize the airborne vehicle.",

Since it is designed from Apple’s perspective, it has a nice sheen and a clean finish. The renders suggest the nice reclining structure of the pod will house occupants comfortably whether on the city street or on the expressway. The two-seat pod for Apple foresees a future where such vehicles will be self-driving from pillar to post carrying and dropping off passengers and quietly moving back to their defined parking spot like a decent Roomba in the house.",

Christened the Citroën La météo (Weather Project) the focus of the designers is on encapsulating the two riders in the ambient weather they’d prefer on any given day, even though the weather on the outside is completely opposite. The inside cabin of this compact pod-like four-wheeler creates the visual and sensory atmosphere to trick you into a completely different realm. So, you could be driving to your destination in the chilly winter of London while feeling and seeing the warmth of the spring New York sun on the inside!",

The efficiency of the EGG’s electric drivetrain permits the car to maintain good range even when treading the off-roading trails. Since vision and blind spots can be a real problem while driving in treacherous and unfavorable weather conditions, the designer lends the Hyundai EGG a 360-degree panoramic windshield for clear visibility for a safer drive.",

The headlights and the front section edges forward – sort of intimidating the onlooker, giving me the ultimate Batcycle vibe the first time I glanced at it. The double-sided long swing arm gives the crime-fighting ride a low-slung position as the leaning forward position of the rider means it can be driven at break-neck speeds. Bax Moto MK3 is draped in an all-black finish with hints of gray to add contrast and depth.Funiq. The instrument cluster and the wheels carry the same grungy feel spiced up by the subtle lines that are apparent on the fuel tank are as well. This in a way signifies the spirit of speed and motion. Another peculiar addition to the bike is the offset headlight with the pair of fog lights – giving it a very unique sense of styling."

Saleem’s 570s concept sports a semi-bare design with parts of the bodywork removed for more rugged emphasis. To be honest, while the idea of removing a car’s bodywork does feel like desecrating its design, there’s also a case to be made that a car’s underlying chassis can sometimes be just as beautiful as its body panels. Just take a look at this wild stripped-apart Lamborghini Huracan from last year.",

Saleem isn’t scared of tapping into his wild side, and that’s a characteristic that shows in his cars too. The 570s seems like a hobby project for now, although I’d pay top dollar to see someone actually custom-build one. Saleem’s design, aptly named the 570s Unhinged, sports a few significant modifications. The front and rear look nothing like the original, with an exposed, modified chassis (with a few reinforcements) that allows for monstrously wide wheels, redesigned headlights + taillights (I really like Saleem’s continuous taillight detail), and even a modded exhaust system. If a regular 570s is Bucky Barnes, the Unhinged concept feels like the Winter Soldier in a blind fit of sheer unbridled fury.

Someone who likes to pedal to the mountains or spend a whole lot of time going for extended bike runs in the morning for fitness. Safety is another important thing that the bike lock addresses as the taillight adds another layer of visibility for motorists to take note of when on the go.

Vento is a mindset.” Composed of four main components, Vento is like a miniature wind turbine. Constructed from recycled plexiglass and aluminum, Vento’s microturbine harvests wind energy while the bicycle is in motion. Then, the energy is converted into electricity through electromagnetic induction that takes place in the turbine’s generator. The bicycle light’s battery then stores this energy and the LED bulb generates light. While moving in your bike, the wind is always whipping past you, so the light will always work when needed.

As the rider keeps moving forward, the air passes through the front vents on the front and enters the air channel. Simultaneously air is drawn from the rear via a small brushless fan that projects the air to the breathable position. Air entering the Airban helmet from both these channels is filtered through the HEPA filter which removes 99.97% of 0.3 μm particulates.

The Thor’s advanced electrical architecture brings to the fore regenerative braking energy as the motors can be used to apply torque to the wheels in both directions.",

The trailer can be operated remotely too via an app when it’s detached from the towing vehicle. So, you can reposition it on a campsite or alight it for hitching up to a vehicle. The modern travel trailer comes with solar panels for off-grid camping on extended adventures. On the inside, it is loaded with things like voice and touchscreen activated climate and lighting controls.",

In that scenario, leisure time with the cat or dog would be a relieving experience. Thus, this EV design is created to ensure that the owner and the pet can move in and out of the vehicle with ease. It would have a large WZ-GO-style door on the rear that would enable the pet to access her space in the back of the vehicle.",

The space inside is divided into two sections (open in the middle). The front of the vehicle is reserved for the human while the back is a play area for the pet supplied with balls, toys, cat scratchers and more. The human cockpit can be transformed into an office. The dashboard pulls out to form a table, you have a projector, speakers for entertainment, and a coffee machine to keep you high on caffeine!",

For example, he had to basically use a Nintendo Switch for one project while using a sheet of wood for another. It was, however, all worth it.",

The first is perhaps a bit more common, an arcade cabinet that plays the game the way it is meant to be played, with a steering wheel. The more interesting project, however, is the hovercraft, a vehicle that is admittedly not present in the game. Granted, it’s also less sustainable, with the use of large fans and electricity to lift the lightweight construction off the ground. Seeing it slide over a smooth indoor gym floor, however, might make you forget that, even for a brief moment.",

The wizarding world of Harry Potter hasn’t exactly been receptive to technological advances, and it can be clearly seen even the most mundane of these magical tools.

The broomstick, for example, strayed little from the traditional designs of medieval broomsticks, complete with crooked shafts and unmanageable brushes. There’s plenty of room for design exploration and experimentation, of course, and the Nimbus 2022 concept sticks out as one that is the most believable, especially to one that has seen electric scooters of this non-fictional age.",

The basic bent profile is still present, almost a nod to the natural shapes of wands that wizards use. The concept does give the vehicle, if one could call it that, a brush-up, almost literally. The aluminum material of the shaft plus the nearly uniform strands of the brush make it look more like an artist’s paintbrush or even a makeup brush.",
            "The most critical upgrades, however, are the addition of a proper seat and some semblance of modern electronics. Witches and wizards have been bearing the pain of riding on a stick for centuries, so it’s high time that comfort becomes a priority in the design of a broomstick. The handle also shows the equivalent of an instrumentation panel, but we’ll presume it’s magic-driven instead of electricity-powered. Of course, the design has room for customization, or rather for proudly showing off our House colors.",
            "The Nimbus 2022 is an interesting take on what was one of Harry Potter’s most iconic props, though it’s also easy to see how this new design probably won’t sit well with the Ministry of Magic.

Many may beg to differ, but I think the purpose is defied when a vehicle capable of ferrying up to five people has just one or two alighting at the car park. That’s the primary reason I may for a minute visualize streets filled with two-seaters.",
            "An Apple Car in that domain is slightly an overboard assumption but then we have been through a number of Apple Car concepts in the past, and all of them have some level of irrationality. Filling the gap between imagination and reality these are the best of what we know the Apple Car would be but the Apple Autonomous concept has a different idea. The two-seat pod for Apple foresees a future where such vehicles will be self-driving from pillar to post carrying and dropping off passengers and quietly moving back to their defined parking spot like a decent Roomba in the house.",
            "The thought of riding an Apple Car is in itself appealing, but even if we believe all the hype and buildup around the possibility of an autonomous electric Apple Car, we are not going to get to ride one before 2028 at least. The car is expected to be in a very early stage of the development cycle and there are no images to show how it would be, so concepts like the Apple Autonomous piques interest.",
            "This 360-degree movable autonomous car has a door that flings open to reveal a cocoon-like cockpit with two comfortable seats. Since it is designed from Apple’s perspective, it has a nice sheen and a clean finish. The renders suggest the nice reclining structure of the pod will house occupants comfortably whether on the city street or on the expressway.",

The pandemic has drawn major attention to the need to socially distance, although people with agoraphobia find it difficult to be around other people, to begin with. Orbit aims to hit two birds with one stone, providing a public transport system that’s accommodating for all, while still creating a private, personalized travel experience. The larger vehicle acts as a ‘movable nest’ for smaller pods that can independently dislodge from the main body of the Orbit and complete last-mile pickups and drop-offs for people. The main vehicle covers fixed frequent routes while the individual pods provide access in remote areas, picking them up from their locations and taking them to the main vehicle, which transports everyone in their own enclosed bubble!",

            "The Indian Railways is among one of the world’s largest rail networks, although 41% of its accidents and 63% of its fatalities happen OUTSIDE the train, on railway crossings. Kiran Babu’s Concept Holosafe aims at making the railway crossing not only safer but much more informative too. There’s a sense of complacency when you see the barricade descend at a railway crossing, and most people simply assume that they’ve got a reasonable window of time to cross before the train ACTUALLY arrives because the barricade doesn’t tell you how long you have to wait. This attitude is so prevalent at unmanned crossings in India that the government has decided to completely close off all unmanned crossings in the interest of public safety. Kiran Babu’s solution is a novel one that promotes safety by eliminating complacency and replacing it with actionable information. While it isn’t entirely possible to prevent people from crossing over at unmanned railway crossings, Babu’s solution implements a holographic counter that acts as a ‘traffic light’ of sorts. The holographic barricade creates a virtual ‘red zone’ with a countdown clock to let people know how long they’ll be waiting at the crossing, and when the train passes by, it turns into a green zone with a countdown clock too, giving people a realistic idea of the time they’ve got before the zone turns red again. Sounds a lot like a certain Squid Game event, but hey… this one’s actually designed to SAVE lives!",

            "After a tiring week at work, with the weekend joyfully looming ahead of me, I often find myself fantasizing about a short sweet getaway! Just a few days away from my hectic life, and this hectic world, in a bubble of my own, where all my worries are nowhere to be seen. The pandemic may restrict my actual traveling plans, but it definitely cannot restrict my daydreams about vacations! Jetsetting on a flight may not be a practical option right now, but I do think Camping is a plausible plan. There’s nothing more comforting or exciting than lounging about in a cozy camper while you explore the countryside. You never feel out of place, because these little campers manage to feel like a home on wheels! Fill it up with your dear belongings, and it’s your home away from home. Not to mention the camper designs today are super innovative and inventive! These resourceful campers manage to cater to almost all of our needs, solving various problems, and turning our camping experience into a fulfilling and comfortable one.",
            "This ingenious expandable camper comes with a slide-out expansion option right above where the lift-up tailgate galley would be. This turns the compact teardrop into a full-sized caravan to accommodate a family of four. When completely expanded the camper makes enough room for a master bedroom, indoor kitchen, wet bathroom, and a sizeable dining area. So, we are talking of the best of both worlds – the compact footprint of a teardrop trailer and the airy layout of a large caravan! The Campervan Raptor XC teardrop camper by Hunter Nature is a prime example of a rugged camper that has plenty of room thanks to its ingenious design.",
            "Designed for urban landscape while exploring the countryside, the FlexCamp off-road camper trailer expands vertically and to its one side to increase the inside space by almost double. It’s essentially a very basic trailer or pickup-top box that morphs into a micro-cabin for four people! If already campers and RVs weren’t popular, another cool dimension is making them an irresistible prospect. Yes, I’m talking about the ability to expand when parked, to increase the interior space. This clever feature keeps the RV small when on the road, and as soon as it is time to rest, it expands to make optimum use of the available space. Raptor XC teardrop camper by Hunter Nature impressed us with its expandable capability and now the FlexCamp compact camper by ICC Offroad has caught our eye.",
            "Ten years after the Temporary Living competition, De Markies saw its first prototype and received 1996’s Rotterdam Design Prize’s Public Prize for it. Fast forward to 2021 and De Markies is still turning heads. Built with accordion-like expansions, De Markies’s shape begins as a cubic camper on the road and triples in size to form a complete semicircle. Once De Markies expands into its final shape, the camper’s main bedroom can be found inside of its opaque orange awning, while a sunroom comes into shape underneath the van’s transparent awning. Inside the caravan, a kitchen, bathroom, and sitting room come with all the amenities needed for a comfortable retreat on the road, including a stove, sink, countertop, storage space, and tables.",
            "Droplet campers are ergonomic and reliable. The Droplet XL also thrives on this image in a lightweight form factor, which can be towed by any RV. This cool feature means people who do not have a larger truck or towing vehicles – such as the city dwellers – can also haul this teardrop trailer behind their cars for a weekend off-site or a slightly longer adventure trip. What sets the new model apart from the premier iteration is its high focus space, larger panoramic windows and skylights, and extensive storage to keep all the camping gear out of sight and completely safe.",
            "Breaking the shackles of mainstream travel trailer design and purposefulness is the Happier Camper HC1 which is one of the most versatile campers on the road thanks to its modular floor and a big hatch. It has an adaptive interior setup called Adaptiv system, comprising of six different components that fix into the floor like LEGO and make the modularity possible. These include a bench, kitchenette, table, cushion, floor panel, and lid. You can slot the components into place for a wide variety of interior layouts or even use these components as outdoor furniture sitting by the campfire or for outdoor cooking fun. The camper can also be left empty for hauling cargo if needed, which is a good added utility.",
            "Christened the Stella Vita, the curvacious camper is the work of 22 student teams at the prestigious university in the Netherlands. Unlike other solar-powered house on wheels, which rely for the most part on external electric power, this one is purely powered by the sun’s energy without any external assistance. It’s made possible with the 8.8-meter square solar array on top of the roof – capable of generating power for the 60-kWh battery. In the parked mode the slide-out panels span out for an impressive canopy area of 17.5 meters square. To add to the goodness, the pop-up roof expands the vertical area for two people to move around comfortably. They can cook comfortably in the kitchen or take a shower too with this feature.",
            "Transforming the Mercedes Vito L2H1 into a modern-day minimalist camper meant creating a nomadic living environment for Serge Propose. The French atelier hollowed out the inside of Mercedes Vito L2H1 to outfit it with a sleeping and lounge area, rear kitchen, and plenty of storage space throughout. Constructed from birch plywood, the wooden interior living area is also insulated with hemp wool and projected cork so campers will stay warm during the night and colder months without leaving the van turned on. Stocked with adaptable furnishings and concealed storage compartments, Serge Propose thought of everything when converting the Mercedes Vito L2H1.",
            "Now available for shipping in the US, VanLab’s flatpack van conversion kits require only two electric screwdrivers and can be assembled inside your van between three and six hours, then all that’s left to do is configure the wiring. Like IKEA furniture, VanLab’s conversion kits can be built by anyone; no carpentry experience is necessary. Speaking to the ease of assembly, VanLab founders note, “Absolutely anyone can build this kit. All the holes are pre-drilled and the panels are pre-cut. All you need to do is follow the simple instructions in the manual provided and screw the panels together.” Constructed from Baltic Birch plywood, the wooden panels come pre-finished and are designed to fit together like puzzle pieces so anyone can give rise to their van outfittings with ease.",
            "Equipped with front-wheel drive, Boaterhome’s front end works as a sort of socket for the hulled boat to slide into like a tow. The front end of the Boaterhome functions as a trailer for the boat to latch onto for the two parts to merge into a boat-van hybrid on a seamless boat connection. To get his boat on the water, John reverses the van to meet the shoreline and dislodges the boat, allowing it to slide easily from the van’s trailer into the body of water. Complete with a Mercury Marine 200hp DFI outboard engine, the fiberglass boat can reach speeds up to 64.3 km/h. While on the road, the van-boat hybrid maxes out at 161 km/h.",
            "Cortes Campers manufactures retro-styled trailers using patent-pending biaxial aluminized fiberglass, carbon fiber and finishes them with marine-grade Gelcoat. In addition to their feathery weight, these travel trailers are extremely durable, robust, well-insulated, and long-lasting. Since the camper lacks a wooden interior, one could count it out for being grungy, but your thought is instantly altered at the first look of the glossy interiors. The camper is not short on facilities either, it comes equipped with a double or twin bed for ease of sleeping people of all age groups – at the end of the trailer is a dining area equipped with a carbon fiber/Kevlar table, which transforms into a bed. The luxurious yet nostalgic retro travel trailers are also equipped with a kitchen featuring a full-sized refrigerator, microwave, oven, a cooktop, and a sink, and has a bathroom with a toilet, sink, and shower. The trailer also comes fitted with HDTV, heating and cooling solutions, and water tanks for fresh and gray water."

            "While Batmobile is the safer option for the vigilante and superhero who employs technology to his advantage for crime-fighting, the Batcycle (in 1966 Batman TV series), Batblade (in the 1997 Batman & Robin film) and eventually Batpod (for the movie The Dark Knight in 2008 and The Dark Knight Rises in 2012) make him look like a daredevil on a mission to save humanity. So, how will a future Batman two-wheeled ride be like? Would it be loaded with technology and retain the same gargantuan proportions or evolve into a more compact ride for agility and super grippy cornering speed?",
            "Designer: FangYi",
            "Well, if we have to go by what concept artist FangYi interprets, it will be a fully autonomous Batpod with the Batman missing from the equation. Why I say that, because the designer mentions nothing of the inspiration or the way this dystopian world ride operates. So, I’m left with nothing but my own creative freedom to give the WR322 UGV the star status quo. And what better than the Batman association, since it looks tailored for the superhero. The sharp geometric lines, all matte black skin, the mysterious character, and of course the fat wheel look. Everything suggests, this badass electric motorcycle is crafted for superhuman feats.",
            "The bike has a very high ride height position, and I’m assuming the closed body shape opens up like bat’s wings to make space for the Batman to hop on the seat when it’s time to take matters his in his hands, and drive to the hot crime scene taking on the bad guys one-on-one. The wheelbase suggests it is going to be highly maneuverable in tight city corners without any loss of traction whatsoever. Perhaps, the logical progression of a two-wheeled accomplice Batman would do very well within modern crime-infested society."

            "With a dizzying level of detail all the way down to the cylinders on the engine and even the needles on the speedometer, this tiny Suzuki GAX1300R Hayabusa model shows how versatile and powerful paper is as a material.",
            "If you’re taking out 20 full minutes to watch the video above, be warned, it’s nothing short of sheer madness and devotion. The artist, a Japanese Hobbyist by the moniker of YoshiwoModels, goes into absolute thorough detail, constructing literally every aspect of the superbike just from scraps of paper found in sketchbooks, cardboard boxes, and receipts. If there’s ever been a video that captures true passion and perseverance, it’s this one right here. YoshiwoModels explains his process as he builds out every single part of the Hayabusa, relying on model schematics found online. He talks about his love for the environment and how waste paper can be such a versatile material to work with, while also highlighting his shift to starch-based glues because they aren’t bad for the environment. As he assembles the engine he reflects on how gasoline engines will be obsolete in the future. There’s an inherent respect for the Hayabusa as YoshiwoModels meticulously carves out every single gear and piston from scratch, and the entire video is a phenomenally humbling experience, watching how simple sheets of paper transform into easily the most thoroughly detailed physical model/replica I’ve ever laid eyes on.",
            "Designer: YoshiwoModels",
            "YoshiwoModels’ process is a simple yet painstakingly laborious one. He finds schematics online and meticulously creates plans and outlines of each and every single component, which he then traces onto sheets of paper. For a lightbox, he either uses an illuminated window or relies on the backlight of a computer monitor. The tools YoshiwoModels uses are relatively specialist too… he relies on a hole-punch to create perfect holes in cardboard sheets and uses scalpels and tiny scissors to cut out parts. Assembling the paper scraps isn’t easy too, as Yoshiwo relies on a pair of tweezers to carefully join paper elements together, building first the oil sump, then the engine, the wheels, the chassis, seat, outer body, exhaust, and finally the incredibly tiny elements on the dashboard.",
            "The techniques used by Yoshiwo in this video have their roots Kirigami, a paper-folding style that lets you cut the paper (unlike Origami that only allows you to manipulate paper using folds). In a conscious effort to be as environment-friendly as possible, Yoshiwo doesn’t use any blank or fresh papers in his constructions. For the most part, he relies on boxes and sketchbook covers to create his models and even employs thermal paper found in used receipts, because they can’t be recycled. Once the model is completely ready, Yoshiwo finishes it off by adding the Hayabusa’s kanji logo on the fairing of the superbike.",
            "While the Suzuki Hayabusa is associated with speed and power, this video is the polar opposite, displaying an almost meditative calmness in its slow craftsmanship. Sure, it’s easy to appreciate how beautiful a Hayabusa looks… but when you see every single part of it built and assembled from scratch, it allows you to appreciate the superbike’s design on an entirely different level."

            "It’s time to ditch the automotive clay. A 3D pen works out to be a much cheaper, easier, and more effective way to build out prototypes. A designer/YouTuber by the name of Sanago shows how versatile a 3D pen can be when you want to rapidly build designs from scratch.",
            "Earlier last year, we watched as Sanago built a functioning motorized scale-down model of the Red Light Green Light Doll from Squid Game. With the Porsche Taycan, however, Sanago is demonstrating how the 3D pen is more than just a mere recreational hobbyist device… it has serious potential to be integrated into a designer’s ideation and testing arsenal.",
            "In the video above (and the images below), Sanago covers the prototype-building journey, sketching directly over printed schematics of the Porsche Taycan and building a rough skeleton before ‘filling’ the surfaces in. The process doesn’t purely rely on a 3D pen, however, the pen acts as a primary building device, following which Sanago smoothens the surfaces using heat, sanding bits, and car primer. Once built, the outer body gets treatment with headlights, taillights, a coat of paint, and branding on the front and back. Finally, the car is mounted on an RC platform and taken for a spin outdoors!",
            "If you’re interested in buying a 3D pen, you can find one here.",
            "Designer: Sanago",
            "The 3D pen is used almost like a real pen would be for sketching. First the outlines of the Porsche Taycan are defined, following which the surfaces are ‘cross-hatched’ in. Sanago (who even sells his own 3D pens commercially) makes sure there are absolutely no holes or blank spots in the build. The benefit of using a 3D pen over a 3D printer is the ability to undo mistakes simply by cutting/sanding your mistakes out and rebuilding the parts again correctly.",
            "Once the base model of the Taycan is ready, the 3D printer is discarded for finishing tools, i.e., a heat-knife, sandpaper, and a handheld Dremel sanding tool. While the 3D pen’s process was additive, these tools are subtractive in nature, helping remove any excess material to give you a smooth, clean design. Any mistakes can either be fixed by bringing the 3D pen back in or simply using a bit of heat to adjust the model to your liking.",
            "Once the Porsche’s body is ready, it gets a coating of primer to fill in any dents and gaps. This is where you’re back in regular model-making territory. Although the advantage with a 3D pen (as opposed to using a CNC machine on a block of wood or metal) is the ability to quickly build hollow models that are exceedingly lightweight and require measurably less time to construct.",
            "The Porsche Taycan gets a coat of paint before being fitted with heat-formed headlights and edge-lit acrylic taillights that have LEDs mounted on the behind. Finally, Sanago cuts clear tinted acrylic pieces for the windows and front and rear windshields, while adding the final details like the logo on the front, model number on the back, and a license plate for good measure!",
            "Once the car’s ready (and mounted on a toy RC car base), Sanago takes it for a test drive. The toy car doesn’t perform rather well against overwhelmingly snowy terrain, but its wheels do cause snowflakes to shoot backward into the air for dramatic effect!",
            "The overall YouTube video (which has nearly 5 million views) is just 18 minutes long, although one could assume Sanago took nearly, if not under, a week to complete the build, factoring in the primer and paint drying times too. Ultimately though, this is a victory for the 3D pen, showing how effective it can be for constructing models and prototypes in days without spending weeks building and perfecting 3D CAD models, and then shooting them to a 3D printer which takes hours to make (with a high failure rate too). Making models with the 3D pen is about as easy as sketching. All you really need are a few schematics and a decent amount of plastic filament!",

This is one of the most eye-catchy things seen at the Omicron inflicted show in Las Vegas this year. BMW calls it the iX Flow Concept and although it seems like any other iX crossover prototype, what it has got is something straight out of a Transformers movie plot. A futuristic car that can blend right into its surroundings to go invisible magically!",
            "Well, that is a far-fetched dream for now, as the EV for now uses E Ink technology (much like the Amazon Kindle series’ display) to put forth a hypnotic show of color-changing skin. The implementation is in its infancy stage right now, as the iX Flow Concept can switch between the hues of white, dark gray and black only. According to BMW the E Ink is sandwiched in a wrap that conforms to the “contours of the all-electric Sports Activity Vehicle.” Millions of microcapsules (the diameter of a human hair) are etched in this wrap containing the negatively charged white pigment and positively charged black pigment. Based on the amount of pigment needed to collect on the surface, the electric field is applied to do the trick – something known as electrophoresis technology.",

This is useful in maintaining the cabin temperature too as, on hot days, the color of the vehicle could be lighter to reflect more light and darker on colder days to absorb more heat. This will also result in lesser energy requirements to maintain the optimum inside temperature Munich-based premium car manufacturer says, the future versions of the car could follow the color-changing aesthetics to the grille and wheels too. Thereby, resulting in complete customization of the ride with the touch of a button on a compatible app.",
            "The production version of the iX Flow Concept is far from meeting fruition as the color-changing skin is temperature sensitive and works only in certain conditions. Once that bit is sorted, we are staring at limitless options when it comes to displaying custom graphics, messages, or even color flow actuated by the music being played inside. Of course, we expect BMW to evolve this color-changing EV into one that can display millions of colors like current-gen OLEDs. For now, this concept could very well make it through to sci-fi or in fact Bond movie plot!"

The mega yacht (or should I say a big catamaran) measuring 492 feet will be a revolution in the aviation industry with its twin airships filled with helium. These gigantic airships will be connected via a central carbon deck measuring 33 feet wide consisting of a master cabin, living area, and a large dining section. The outer edges of the airship have five en suite staterooms each, so taking along best buddies for the adventure of their lifetime is certain.",

The ultra-light batteries store power and deliver it to the eight contra-rotating electric rotors on the side when required. To propel such a large airship a huge amount of helium gas is required, and the Air Yacht stores it in honeycomb-like hives holding close to 14.1 million ft3 of compressed helium. As a result, this craft can fly for 48 hours non-stop, at a speed of 60 knots!",

Right by the helipad is an exquisite swimming pool for sun-soaked leisure days. All these features make this flying vessel an exclusive possession for the affluent whenever someone is enchanted by Lazzarini Design Studio’s ideation. When it’s time to land the rotors shift the position downwards for the needed thrust to land smoothly. The helium is depressurized and the ballast anchoring system keeps it steady on the water while being propelled forward at a speed of 5 knots.",
            "Having talked of all the advantages of such aircraft, we also have to dig our memories and remember the LZ 129 Hindenburg disaster. The perils of highly inflammable hydrogen gas have been replaced by non-inflammable gas for a safer journey while being airborne. But the gas leaks and the whole rig coming down crashing on the ground due to lack of adequate helium pressure in the airships cannot be counted out. But at face value, this aircraft is absolutely something the future will take with both hands open. I just hope, the advanced future technologies will solve the little loopholes with such aircraft for safer expeditions."

            "And the father of the year award goes to…",
            "While buying a HIGHLY limited edition $28 million dollar luxury car isn’t in everyone’s realm of capabilities, a Vietnamese dad decided to just take matters into his own hands and build a miniature working replica of the Rolls-Royce Boat Tail from scratch. Meet Trương Văn Đạo, father and sole proprietor of ND Woodworking Art, a wood workshop and YouTube channel that captures Văn Đạo in action as he builds out miniature replicas of the world’s most sought-after automobiles. Last year, Văn Đạo built out a mini-sized Lamborghini Sian out of wood, complete with butterfly doors and an electric power train. This time around, he decided to step things up a notch and build what’s touted as quite literally the most expensive street-legal car on the market today. Văn Đạo’s replica of the Boat Tail doesn’t just scale the grand tourer down… it comes with opening doors, functional headlights/taillights, and actual driving capabilities (no, it doesn’t come with a V12 like the original)… but the cherry on the cake? Well, the rear butterfly trunk which opens to reveal a set of glasses, some juice-boxes, and a place to dock an umbrella as you sip on orange juice while seated behind the luxury car!",
            "The video at the top documents the second half of the two-part video series covering Văn Đạo’s build process. It’s remarkable how he builds the entire car from scratch, not even relying on any sort of existing toy car chassis or even any material other than wood. Văn Đạo starts by putting together large wooden pieces together that make up the overall mass of the car before carving away at it with a chainsaw to get it to somewhat resemble the original. It’s fair to assume that the process takes months, especially given that Văn Đạo also has a day job at Google.",
            "In the process, Văn Đạo also assembles the car’s powertrain, which fits in the rear of the car, right below the drink-holding trunk. Unlike the Boat Tail, this tiny replica uses a battery-powered motor instead of a V12 – the result is a car that gracefully drives through streets instead of setting speed records. To finish off, he uses various tools from sanding machines to hole-saw bits to make all the details from the holes for the headlights to the slots for the windshield, doors, and other details to fit in. The car uses different grades of wood, from a lighter wood for the body and interiors to darker woods for details like the grilles, parts of the dashboard, and even the Spirit of Ecstasy statuette that sits on the hood of the car! The entire vehicle gets a layer of lacquer once it’s ready to show the world.",
            "Once meticulously assembled, the video ends with the father taking his son for a spin in the newly fabricated vehicle, and even stopping in a corner to bust out the drink caddy fitted into the back of the car. The father and son then share a glass of orange juice together, making memories that will undoubtedly be more valuable than a $28 million car can ever be!",

            "Autonomous, self-driving cars have long been a dream of both car manufacturers as well as many drivers, but they also sound like the stuff of sci-fi horror for other people, especially those outside of the robot vehicle. Although it’s a long time coming, these driverless cars will eventually be found on highways as well as neighborhood streets, whether ferrying people or groceries. Nuro is more interested in the latter, and its latest prototype design makes a big commitment not just to the safety of people but also that of the environment.",
            "Designer: Nuro",
            "Nuro has been around for quite a while, but it might not be getting as much attention as self-driving cars from bigger brands like Tesla. That might be due to its focus on a very specific market for delivering goods, not humans, from the store to your doorstep. In a way, that also works in its favor because it can fine-tune its features and performance in ways that more general-purpose autonomous vehicles can’t.",
            "For example, Nuro’s latest-gen version of its driverless R2 pod adds a new safety feature for pedestrians that sounds both absurd and genius in its simplicity. While it will try to avoid any accident as much as it can, it will also deploy an external airbag in front of the vehicle when it can’t. This is designed to help reduce the force of impact and hopefully reduce the number of injuries to pedestrians. That, of course, will still depend on how fast the vehicle was traveling in the first place, and this latest iteration can apparently go up to 45 mph.",
            "Nuro is also making big promises when it comes to sustainability and protecting the environment. It will be impossible at this point to go all out on using renewable materials, but it will at least try to make sure to reduce its impact on the environment. More importantly, Nuro says that the new electric vehicle will use 100% renewable electricity from wind farms in Texas, reducing the carbon footprint even for day-to-day operations.",
            "This third-gen autonomous delivery vehicle also has more space for groceries, food, and other items. Nuro says that all these upgrades are designed not just to make deliveries faster and more efficient but also to free up more time for humans to spend on more important things, like family and friends. That said, pre-production of the manufacturing facility that will make these driverless delivery robots has only just begun, so it might be a while before we see these on the road."

Realized the complexity, the challenge, wanted to implement all the functions”, he added. The overall build required detailing every single aspect of the vintage car, from the suspension to the bodywork, gearbox, lifting system, lights, and the special LEGO Fiber Optic pieces that were only available in bulk. (You can see them come to life in the image below)",
            "Moving onto smaller details, Mr. Platinum didn’t just stop at making a realistic car. Switches on the dashboard actually power the headlights, taillights, and indicators, and if you stop to look closer, he’s even built out the DMC logo on the front using just LEGO pieces. A DeLorean sticker on the back may be the only visible non-lego piece in this entire build. Mr. Platinum pointed out the arduous journey this dream-build took him on. Most of the car’s parts were regularly available as a part of standard sets, although there were a few parts that had to be sourced from vintage collections dating back to the late 80s, and the mudguards (which Mr. Platinum couldn’t find in the right color) had to be sourced from China.",
            "Although you can’t really buy this DeLorean, Mr. Platinum’s been more than kind to make the schematics available (be warned… the instructions span 3 different PDF files with a total of 1200 pages of instructions). The Bluetooth-operated car runs on a rear-wheel-mounted RC motor that’s powered by a single AAA battery.",
            "The end result is nothing short of fantastic and measures 21.8 inches in length, weighing in at a staggering 6.8 pounds all included. You can buy Mr. Platinum’s schematics from ReBrickable for $22.8 (€19.95), although be prepared to shell out a couple of grands if you’re really serious about building this retrofuturistic beauty."

These luxurious vessels are taking over water bodies, and are slowly becoming a preferred means to travel from one destination to another. How exciting would it be to explore beautiful locations in these exotic vehicles? I mean you now have yachts that function as solar-powered floating villas, while some are even inspired by sportscars! The yacht experience has been elevated to a whole ‘nother ball game. And, we’ve curated a collection of the best yachts we’ve come across! From a conceptual swan-shaped yacht to a superyacht with a gaping void in the middle – this collection of automotive designs will leave you completely impressed, and itching to get aboard one!",
            "Christened “The Shape” this superyacht breaks all the fundamental rules of sailing and yacht design that we’ve seen so far. It has a gaping hole right in the middle (just like the ones in modern skyscrapers) that serves as the sun deck and a never-before-seen unique visual attraction. How it will address the turbulent seas when the weather is hostile, is a question for another day! The beastly concept is 69 meters long and having a draft of 3.90 meters yacht offers a living area of 35 meters past the void. It has three decks hidden in the colossal structure – the first floor having the suites, the second one being the shared living space, and the command center on the third.",

So, has the Italy-based design house finally hit saturation with its thinking cap on? Most definitely not, as the 279-foot Icaria vessel hones massive deck space for two helicopters to park and a full-fledged tender garage to house a couple of watercraft, accessible via two foldable doors. The superyacht has an imposing bow followed by a large glass bridge. Icaria is more tailored for explorers who like to tread out into the rough waters. For times when adventure seekers need to relax in the warmth of the sun, there is the gorgeous deck right by the hollowed-out area the designers refer to as “hole deck.”",
            "Pierpaolo Lazzarini of Lazzarini Design Studio is known for his unique and extraordinary watercraft creations and this swan-shaped concept yacht called ‘Avanguardia’ tops the list. The name means ‘vanguard’ and it comes from the position of its control tower which is perched like a swan’s head. Can you guess which 1970’s Japanese manga unintentionally inspired this? Avanguardia is subdivided into 5 decks and can fit up to 60 passengers. The  ‘swan head’ is the control tower that is used to maneuver this 137-meter long, almost outrageous, yacht. Another interesting feature about the control tower is that it can detach from the ‘neck’ and transform itself into an auxiliary 16-meter boat. When in motion, the mobile control tower can adjust Avanguardia’s position by lowering itself right into the center of the yacht.",

The two companies have not collaborated on the design, so you cannot earmark this one as official, but the concept has a design worth seeing the light of the day someday. Beyond the inspired look, the Gran Turismo Mediterranea is an 88-foot, sporty yacht, made using the Ferrari-favored carbon fiber. Undeniably Ferrari for the seas, this design renders appear with a Ferrari badge on the front, gullwing doors and a cabin that welcomes the owner and crew into a sportscar-esque cockpit that ensure you don’t feel any difference from the Italian stallion’s driver seat to the pilot seat of this hyper yacht.",

This watercraft would be stored in a superyacht and is designed to haul around 50 passengers from one location to the other for short travels. Much like the Xenos hyper yacht and the Jet Capsule, this one being 23 meters in length is bigger than the Jet Capsule and smaller than Xenos- suggesting a fleet of hyper watercraft in the making for a profound travel experience on the seas.",
            "The Tecnomar pulls inspiration directly from the Lamborghini Sián FKP 37’s design details (the two even feature together in the video). Outwardly, it’s pretty easy to draw parallels between a car and yacht, simply because they both need to be incredibly aerodynamic and streamlined, but the Tecnomar manages to do so much more to look the part (apart from the angular bodywork, of course). Take for instance the Y-shaped headlights, a detail that’s directly taken from Lamborghini’s playbook (remember the Terzo Millennio), or the zig-zag stepping on the rear of the yacht that’s inspired by the rear profile of the Aventador.",

We leverage Arkup products and expertise for fast deployment, modular, floating communities that you scale according to market demands,” says the team.",
            "The designer has created the blueprint of the 85-foot superyacht dubbed Drakkar S inspired by the ye olde Viking longships, which’s perfect for newbie sailors who would rather prefer the autonomous luxury of a vessel. To make self-propelling possible, Drakkar S is infused with advanced autopilot and artificial intelligence systems for smart navigation – detecting any underwater obstacles or even estimating the ideal distance for mooring. Even more so, it can be controlled with a smartphone app – that just sets the tone for a future Apple yacht in Silver or even the Space Grey colors.",
            "There are over 5,000 superyachts currently on this planet, however, none of them look as impactful as the Estrella. Designed by South Kore-based Yeojin Jung, Estrella hopes to break the mold of ‘boring’ practical superyacht design with something that’s a cross between feasible and outlandishly luxurious. Envisioned to look like the jewel of the seas, Estrella comes made for UHNWIs (or Ultra High Net Worth Individuals, as my sorry self just learned), and sports a split-hull design that divides the yacht into the main component, and two floater components on either side, reminiscent of a seaplane.",

Open to the public, visitors could roam around the moon dressed in virtual space-suits, explore the base, and even zip around the lunar surface on a specially designed conceptual rover called the LUNIAQ, modeled on Skoda’s ENYAQ electric car.",
            "The moonbase’s design takes inspiration from concepts of the Global Moon Village by XTEND DESIGN and the research work of space architect Tomas Rousek at NASA JPL. Tomas previously led the design of SinterHab, the first concept of a 3D-printed lunar module using NASA robotics technology. The settlement would consist of prefabricated, 3D printed, and inflatable modules, supported by solar power systems, launch pads, and other infrastructure. Large robots would print modules using lunar regolith hardened by microwave sintering. Radiation shielding would be also robotically assembled from solar-sintered bricks. Greenhouses would provide not only food but also recycle air and water in a closed-loop bioregenerative life-support system.",
            "LUNIAQ is a concept electric lunar vehicle that seats up to four astronauts and even holds the capacity to be controlled remotely. It takes its visual inspiration from SUVs by Skoda (Czech Republic’s most notable automotive export), while being technically based on NASA’s MMSEV platform (Multi-Mission Space Exploration Vehicle). The front of the car pays tribute to the Skoda ENYAQ, although its large windshield uses transparent aluminum instead of the conventional laminated glass found on Earth-based cars. These transparent aluminum panels offer much more resistance to micrometeorites, and coatings of polyethylene offer radiation protection.",
            "Hatches on each side of the LUNIAQ allow the vehicle to plug into the different modules on the base, allowing people to enter the vehicle without needing to don a suit and perform a spacewalk. At the rear, the rover features a ‘suitport’, a dedicated suiting cabin with two spacesuits that occupants can wear. A door on the rear of the suitport lets the astronauts exit the vehicle safely, without letting lunar dust into the vehicle’s main cockpit.",
            "The level of detail on the LUNIAQ is pretty stunning considering it’s still an entirely conceptual vehicle within a purely virtual experience. Designer Tomas Rousek mentions that the rover runs on solar power, thanks to panels located on the top, which store energy in the car’s solid-state batteries. The roof of the rover even houses stereoscopic cameras to scan the terrain and for 3D imaging to enable the remote and autonomous control of the car, and antennas for communication with the lunar base, Earth, orbital stations and other satellites. “Large soft wheels would offer comfortable driving on bumpy lunar surface thanks to Michelin’s Tweel technology”, Rousek adds.",

So how about you just accept that it isn’t meant to be and move on? How about a little rebound on something like this Ford Bronco concept from the mind of Shanghai-based designer Haoyue Jia.",
            "Jia’s Ford Bronco redesign offers a minimal hybrid between the Bronco’s existing language and the Cybertruck’s nude metallic otherworldly style. I call it a best of both worlds because it’s clearly pickup truck-like (it doesn’t look like a polygon on wheels) and has a level of softness that seems personable yet muscular. Perfectly proportioned curves make it look reliable and robust without looking stocky or rotund. Besides… it takes a great level of detailing to make a car that looks good even without a coat of paint… and the concept pickup does all this while still not looking overtly traditional, like your run-of-the-mill Ford, Chevy, or GMC.",
            "The redesigned Ford Bronco targets the wanderer, instead of your average pickup truck user. It seats two in the front, with a truck-bed at the back that’s spacious enough for whatever cargo you need to lug, although the Bronco clearly isn’t styled to carry timber from your nearby Home Depot. The slick design caters to the intersectional audience who finds the idea of a pickup truck appealing and likes owning an automobile as powerful as a truck is… so pretty much all of the Cybertruck’s core audience. Given the way it’s designed, the Bronco concept is clearly powered by an electric drivetrain too, putting it square in electric pickup territory… although perhaps my favorite little feature remains the car’s roof, which pops open to reveal a tiny two-person tent for those weekend getaways! Away from the world, the internet, and the news of Tesla moving the Cybertruck production to 2023. *sadface*",

This gave designer Alejandro Llisterri the perfect opportunity to let his imagination loose and craft a Hyundai i10-inspired concept that is much more than just a small city car. In fact, it’s a mini pickup truck for two, ready to take on any adventure coming its way. Christened the Hyundai EGG, this compact off-roading capable set of wheels is a mix of a buggy and compact hatchback.",
            "Alejandro wanted to take a detour from the conventional automotive designs that mostly focus on luxury and comfort. The ideation took him down the path of crafting a reliable electric mini pickup car that has a better mileage even at higher speeds while en route to the neighboring city. The efficiency of the EGG’s electric drivetrain permits the car to maintain good range even when treading the off-roading trails. Since vision and blind spots can be a real problem while driving in treacherous and unfavorable weather conditions, the designer lends the Hyundai EGG a 360-degree panoramic windshield for clear visibility for a safer drive.",
            "The spare tire takes up the spot above the boot section of the EV, and based on the front grill design, I can safely bet the battery is placed on the front and not the rear of the vehicle. Thereby, the rear can hold a respectable amount of cargo for an expedition for two in the woods. Those big chunky tires and the sharp aesthetics reminiscent of the Tesla Cybertruck are evoking enough for early adopters to keep interested in this cute little monster. Hyundai EGG has surely got the futuristic influence in its design for me to vouch for it to lay rubber on the city streets and off-road trails someday.

Our typical fossil-fuel-consuming means of transportation need to be replaced by greener and more environment-friendly alternatives, and Electric Bicycles are an appealing option! Not only do they curb fuel consumption and reduce automotive emissions, but they’re also a healthy source of exercise for us! I mean, not only do we get to save the Earth from air pollution, but we can also get some intense cardio done. And they’re becoming an increasingly popular option day by day. It’s estimated that by 2023, the total number of electric bicycles in circulation around the world, will be 300 million, which is an exponential increase, from the 200 million back in 2019. It looks like everyone is slowly and steadily hopping onto the e-bicycle bandwagon! And, we’ve curated a whole range of innovative designs for you. From a sleek portable e-bike with a unique three-fold mechanism to a transforming and self-balancing unicycle – we have a whole collection of sleek, modern, and super cool e-bikes for you!",
            "This e-bike concept from BaoPham Design features centerless wheels that reduce the rotating inertia found in heavier wheels. Equipped with slim road bike tires, BaoPham’s concept e-bike boasts an aerodynamic build that cuts out the extra drag from air pressure and skin friction to give the bike a speedy ride. Conceptualized with a swift, Z-frame, the e-bike concept from BaoPham Design would host an electric motor located in the bike’s rear-wheel rotor that would be activated once the pedals are moved. The Z-frame of BaoPham Design’s e-bike would be constructed entirely from metal or aluminum for a sleek look and swift ride. Additionally, the hubless wheels of BaoPham Design’s e-bike reduce the rotating inertia found in wheels with spokes and a hub.",
            "E-bikes are a household name now, they are a common mode of transportation in many cities – with safety norms – for cyclists. Add to that the convenience of being able to fold the bike instantly, and it becomes a versatile option to get from point A to B efficiently, effectively, and quickly. To ensure this portability and convenience, the ONEBOT-S7 uses a unique three-fold structure – as opposed to the two-step folding design that we all are familiar with – which makes the e-bike ultra-compact when folded so it can fit in the boot of the car or slide under your workstation (however and wherever you please to use it). Compressed into the smallest single unit possible, this e-bike when folded measure only 60cm in height and length and just 35cm in width. ONEBOT-S7 is fitted with a removable battery pack in the frame, tucked neatly under the seat post. It sits there unobstructed and blends with the uniform frame design and colorway eliminating any distraction from the chrome-like finish of the e-bike.",
            "While riding manual unicycles might be too much of a learning curve for most, self-balancing, electric unicycles sound more like something we could all get behind. Titaa, a unicycle with just those sorts of mechanics, conceptualized by Husky Design is a dual-purpose, modular vehicle that can transform from a bicycle into a self-balancing unicycle. In its full form, Titaa is an electric two-wheeler in the shape of a cargo bike. When riding Titaa as a two-wheeler, users sit upright on a curved, elevated seat rest that slopes down toward the bicycle’s set of foot pedals. There, users can rest their feet while the motor charges the e-bike ahead. Built into the rear-wheel component, Titaa runs on a battery-operated system that can be replaced and recharged near the vehicle’s foot pedals.",
            "Dubbed the PXID – A1, this compact electric bicycle folds to the size of a small suitcase for easy transportation in the boot or even be carried to the office floor, that’s if the boss permits. The folding bicycle rides on 14-inch tires and the rear tires get power from the onboard electric battery for assistive riding on ascends. The seat is height adjustable and the revamped design as compared to the earlier S1 model adapts an angular frame design. This gives the A1 a far better foldable aesthetic that’s practical in use. In fact, it is so compact in the foldable position, you can even store more luggage in the boot of your car with the A1 foldable electric bicycle sitting on one corner!",
            "This final design is centered on a lightweight 7005 series aluminum frame and striking hubless wheel characteristics. To finalize the hubless wheel design that is functional to the last detail, Franz took help from his mechanical engineering colleagues. In the end, the off-center axle design had the additional gear to spin the wheels at a proper rate with pedaling motion. This is assisted by the onboard motor for that extra boost on inclines when the throttle is pressed. The Pilot bicycle finally came to life after countless edits and alterations to the design. The next step was to finalize the colors, materials, and finishes.",
            "For the past three years, Lyft has been developing an e-bike that embodies the best in safety technology and low carbon footprint. Now, finally, it sees fruition in the form of this upbeat e-bike. According to Lyft‘s President and Co-Founder John Zimmer Lyft is all about “creating affordable, reliable and joyful transportation experiences – and few things create joy like riding this new e-bike“. The single gear transmission e-bike is built for every kind of rider with improved ergonomics and is pure joy to ride in cities – thanks to the transmission tuning for any kind of speed or road grade. It bears a very sleek form factor perfectly matched to the smooth and adaptive motor integrated into the frame. Keeping in mind the young riders, Lyft’s e-bike comes with personalized features including a built-in speaker system, hydraulic brakes for consistent stopping power, onboard sensors for safety, retroreflective paint to shine in the dark, and lighting effects keeping in mind urban riders demand.",
            "South Korea-based mobility designer Jung Soo Lee has mustered up the niche idea of a two-wheeled commuter for the whole family inspired by the simple line, and that’s the reason she likes to call it the One Line. The idea is darn simple – a line is the mainframe of the commute, and depending on who’s going to use it, One Line can adapt to that form. It can be a classic Korean bicycle with a basket (having integrated light) to keep the groceries you just bought from the supermarket or fresh flowers for your lover. Then in another avatar, it can take the shape of an electric scooter for faster commuting from one place to the other. One scenario for usage is the e-kickboard, wherein the line frame design now functions as the platform for standing. For the first two iterations, the battery is placed under the seat with LED indicators displaying the remaining battery levels.",
            "Called Prototype 0, this velodrome track racing bicycle imagined for speed heads shines out with its unibody design that’s centered on drag reduction and aerodynamic optimization for maximum acceleration with minimum effort. The ultra-slim profile of the Prototype helps in achieving the least possible aerodynamic drag which is great for effortless commuting. The bike is a fixie – a single-speed gear bicycle that is tailored for urban riding for extra degree control. Don’t expect it to be as good for steep ascends or rugged terrain, as it’s purely designed to be a racing demon for smooth tarmac surfaces. The presence of a bigger gear shaft means that the control is going to be the ride’s forte.",
            "Victor Tabares, a designer based in bustling Barcelona, felt inspired to design and produce OOH BIKE. Since this e-bike retains its pedaling capabilities, most of the standout features from OOH BIKE are integrated into the bicycle itself. Just within the cyclist’s periphery vision, the battery levels are displayed along the top of the bicycle’s frame. Lit-up, neon lights signify the bicycle’s battery levels by the quarter. The front wheel on the OOH BIKE is entirely hubless, producing a metropolitan finished look that gives an otherwise integrated and functional bike some style. Additionally, the spokeless front helps rotate the wheel quickly and with little effort. While centerless wheels are primarily, it seems, an aesthetic decision, they do work well in city environments."

To top it off they are very low maintenance which makes them a preferred ride amongst young riders. One downside is the need to constantly keep pedaling since the bicycle pedal and rear wheel are directly connected as they have no flywheel. Another shortcoming of fixed wheel bicycles is exposed when it comes to riding inclined hills. Designer Andrey Avgust wants to get rid of this disadvantage with his intuitive bicycle design fit for the urban landscape and the electrifying world.",

Therefore, came into the picture, the Electric Fixie – a fixed gear bike that has the same working principle of the genre, and the added capability of an electric drive to make riding on inclined roads as easy as that on level ones. Plus, the electric bike has traction control and regenerative braking for battery recuperation. The latter is adjustable via the bike’s handlebar, and as easy as moving a slider knob on the jukebox. Right in the middle of the handlebar lies the Apple Watch-like dial which displays the current speed, battery level, regenerative braking status and more.",

            "While travel restrictions have put a pause on all of our wanderlust-driven tendencies, the idea of uninhibited traveling has never felt more exciting. Getting closer than ever to a tomorrow where we avoid traffic in flying cars and commute to work in jetpacks, designers have been envisioning travel concepts that redefine our ideas of what the future of mobility might look like.",
            "German designer Yida Li contributed his own travel concept called Polestar Röna, an autonomous automobile that transforms between two modes according to different travel needs.",
            "Li calls Polestar Röna’s first mode “Urban Mode,” which finds the automobile in its upright, slim position to be as compact as possible to swerve through packed city streets. In Urban Mode, Polestar Röna accommodates two travelers, leaving enough room for luggage and plenty of leg space. Li also equipped Polestar Röna with a modular build that allows other automobiles to stack on top of cabins, creating a sort of vertical caterpillar of Polestar Rönas.",
            "In Polestar Röna’s “Adventure Mode,” Li turned the vehicle 90-degrees and gave the automobile less ground clearance to resemble the build of conventional sports cars, encouraging drivers to move fast and freely. In this mode, additional automobiles can connect to Polestar Röna like train carts.",
            "Ideal for open, country roads, Polestar Röna’s adventure mode makes the perfect travel companion for long, cross-country road trips. Li also equipped Polestar Röna drivers with the option of autonomous or manual driving modes, optimizing the sense of freedom even in the future of AI-controlled cars.",
            "Designer: Yida Li",
            "Following multiple ideations, Li settled on Polestar Röna’s final form.",
            "Following a period of sketching, Li developed CAD models of Polestar Röna.",
            "In Adventure Mode, Polestar Röna reveals a small ground clearance reminiscent of a sports car.",
            "In both Urban and Adventure Mode, Polestar Röna leaves enough room for luggage. Its design makes Polestar Röna the future of modular mobility."

The two-seater ride has a windshield that opens up completely to the back, giving access to the vehicle, and probably the only entry point to the inside cabin. Yes, it indeed has no gull-winged doors like the classic one!",
            "The DeLorean Motor Company has had its set of controversies, and some even label it as a flawed icon. The first DMC DeLorean rolled out of the production lines in 1980 and just a year later the production was halted with only 9,000 cars seeing the light of day. Presently only around 6,500 DeLoreans are on the road and a clean one carries a value of around $35,000 – $45,000. The chunk of its popularity is attributed to the “Back to the Future” franchise which in itself is a cult favorite movie. There are speculations since long that the classic sports car will make a comeback, and all automotive fans are eagerly waiting for the modern avatar of a car that deserved more than it got!",
            "This concept rendering by transportation designer Onkar H takes a dig at what a DeLorean of the future will be like. Of course, it has to be electric to stand a chance of longevity in the closely contested automotive market that’s going through a metamorphosis for an electric vehicle-dominated near future. An electric DeLorean E powered by 4 high-performance motors and a mid-mounted battery pack is what the passionate fans will take with both hands. After all, it kills two birds with one stone – owning a classic piece of history that doesn’t sound alienated in the EV landscape.",
            "Rightly called the DeLorean E, the two-seater electric avatar of the iconic car is a mashup of the Cybertruck influenced color theme and the modernized edgy lines of the DeLorean. There’s an array of cool LED headlights on the front section and a matrix of taillights bringing in the EV vibe that I liked very much. The windshield is more panoramic now, extending to the roof minus the pillars for an airier feel inside. The hood gets a streamlined geometric pattern to go with the overall flowing character of the vehicle. Overall boxy styling and smooth silhouette of the original DeLorean have been preserved to maintain the nostalgic element. Onkar imagines the DeLorean E in metallic silver and cool blue color variants – I absolutely love that Gen-Z feels of it!",

            "Designed for urban landscape while exploring the countryside, the FlexCamp off-road camper trailer expands vertically and to its one side to increase the inside space by almost double. It’s essentially a very basic trailer or pickup-top box that morphs into a micro-cabin for four people!",
            "If already campers and RVs weren’t popular, another cool dimension is making them an irresistible prospect. Yes, I’m talking about the ability to expand when parked, to increase the interior space. This clever feature keeps the RV small when on the road, and as soon as it is time to rest, it expands to make optimum use of the available space. Raptor XC teardrop camper by Hunter Nature impressed us with its expandable capability and now the FlexCamp compact camper by ICC Offroad has caught our eye.",
            "Quite impressive I must say, considering the small footprint it has while being towed. Given the German company’s prowess in developing robust, all-weather campers in the past, the FlexCamp is another winning design in the making. Mind you, the boxy shape makes it perfect to mount on a pickup bed too. Once parked for camping, the 126 inches long camper trailer’s hydraulic system lifts the roof up and expands the sidewall. That turns the camper’s height from 79 inches to 120 inches, and the width from 80 inches to 131 inches.",
            "This obviously bloats up the inside space as the 79×55 inches raised double bed expands out to one side, thereby, making up more floor space to access the kitchen area. The drawers and slide-out can be pulled out from the bed frame, making good use of available space. For dinner, the tabletop and benches pull out and retract, while for sleep, the cushioned platforms can be taken (measuring 79×47 inches) out to sleep two more people.",
            "Adventure lovers who are keen foodies can use the kitchen either on the inside or removed and fixed to the FlexCamp’s outside for open-air cooking. For this purpose, the camper trailer has a burner gas stove, sink and a 50-L fridge. There’s a hot water shower facility thanks to the Truma Combi furnace or water heater. The pull-out dry toilet houses in the bed frame drawer stack which many might not fancy, but, it solves the purpose at the end of the day. For hand washing the only option is to use the kitchen sink. It’s worth noting that the drawers beneath the bed are accessible both from the outside and inside.",
            "The camper’s double floor makes space for the plumbing and electrical equipment. Also, it can store 250 liters of storage space for other things. With the 75-L fresh and wastewater tanks, optional air conditioner, LED lighting on the interior and exterior, and a 160-Ah LiFePO4 battery, the FlexCamp is tailormade for wanderlust-struck individuals. There’s no word on the pricing for the off-road camper trailer that’s going to debut as the final production version in 2022.",

The feeling of airiness, the perfect ambiance that could be made in heaven for a date night, and modern touches to make the riders feel right at home.",
            "The Hyundai Ioniq Seven (if I may call it) is a symphony of pure bliss on wheels – and why not – everything is staged so perfectly in such a small space. In fact, the space inside looks anything but short of room. That’s mostly attributed to the clever use of illuminated spacing, hypnotic sierras of oyster roof lighting, and panoramic glass windows. The designers have clearly displayed how minimalism doesn’t necessarily mean compromising on style and magical persona. Rather it is all about inculcating elements right where they’ll fulfill the intended purpose for calming down the mind, body, and soul.",
            "The concept here gets fully movable dual seats at the front which can be positioned in any configuration with respect to the static L-shaped couch at the rear. When the wheels are not churning on the highway, the Ioniq Seven’s dashboard is ready for the same rejuvenating lighting treatment, courtesy of the hidden ambient lamp speakers on each side. For me, the silver lining in the interior ambient space is the ambient lamps in the door panels which set the mood lighting to the ideal illuminance.",

            "Meet the Ducati Adventure Scrambler, a concept from the mind of Nazar Eisa (who also gave us this absolute Nissan beast). Designed to offer a distinctly different experience, the Adventure Scrambler concept departs from the regular design language of Ducati’s Scrambler series.",
            "The concept’s styling really sets it apart, blurring the lines between scramblers, dirt bikes, and café racers. While you’d expect a dirt bike to be much more bare-basics and lean, the Adventure Scrambler has a more meaty, sinewy, robust design that gives it that commanding authority a café racer has with its voluminous torso. However, the Ducati Adventure Scrambler concept treads more within Cyberquad territory, with a design that rejects absolutely every chance to have a curved line or surface. Instead, the Adventure Scrambler’s low-poly design gives it its appeal, making it look unnatural… a simple trick created by using pure straight lines, which are never found in nature.",
            "The bike’s side profile has a lot to admire and analyze. The concept’s silhouette has what’s effectively the wheels, ground clearance, and suspension of a dirt bike or adventure bike, but with the mass of a heavier café bike on it. This fusion of sorts, however, is probably one of the last things you notice, given that the bike’s surfacing is its most captivating detail. The edgy form factor is accentuated by the Ducati Adventure Scrambler’s exquisite paint-job, a combination of brushed black metal and rose gold. It’s rare to see this color-way used on adventure two-wheelers, but then again, the concept is FAR from being conventional at this point!",
            "Another standout feature is the bike’s steely cold stare, brought about by four edge-lit elements that present themselves on the front of the two-wheeler as its headlight setup. The headlights reinforce the underlying theme of ‘no straight lines’ and do away with the conventional circular headlamp (practically an icon with Ducati’s scramblers). While some bikes ditch single headlamps for a dual-lamp setup, the Adventure Scrambler concept replaces that with four ‘eyes’ that look at you with a stare that says a lot – starting with “get out of the way”!",
            "Nazar Eisa’s Adventure Scrambler does a pretty good job of aesthetically shaking things up by disturbing the comfortable lull most scramblers, café racers, and dirt bikes have settled into. From its form language to its details and even the paint-job, it creates a bike that’s best described as a combination of unconventional and futuristic. Even though scramblers and dirt bikes are made as endurance machines, the Ducati Scrambler Concept also shows that they can be made desirable enough to even be used on roads too… and I’m sure this bad-boy would turn a whole bunch of heads. Sadly though, the bike exists just as a fan-made concept for now (it isn’t formally associated with the Ducati brand), although the template it sets could easily spawn a few custom builds, no? Any enthusiastic bike designers looking to bring this to life?",

So, we are talking of the best of both worlds – the compact footprint of a teardrop trailer and the airy layout of a large caravan!",

This has had a surge in the number of camper trailers in production as makers try to fulfill the unique set of demands of customers who won’t settle for anything ordinary. The Campervan Raptor XC teardrop camper by Hunter Nature is another prime example a rugged camper that has plenty of room thanks to its ingenious design.",
            "Hunter Nature is fairly new in the market debuting its first caravan in 2019 with a vision to plug the loopholes other campers in the market avoid or are unable to address. They started off with small all-terrain trailers in a more conventional body, and now they’ve taken the big leap in the form of the Raptor XC expandable camping trailer. According to them, the expandable camper is made to be towed with a Land Rover Defender or Toyota Land Cruiser – of course, it can be towed with other capable 4×4 off-roaders too!",
            "That’s a perfect case scenario for an escapade to the quaint campsite by the river bank. The trip can be a short one or even a longer expedition because Raptor XC gives the owners plenty of options, and does not restrict the adventurous lifestyle. Keeping in mind the teardrop camper will bear the brunt of the elements, there’s a sandwich of exterior and interior aluminum walls on the XPS insulation. To make the ride smooth on all terrains, the shape-shifting camper is loaded with BFGoodrich all-terrain tires in alloy wheels. The independent suspension system should take on most of the imperfections encountered on the tarmac and on dirt trails.",
            "The expandable section of the camper can be controlled manually or owners can also go for the remote-controlled motor system option too. In fully expanded configuration the Raptor XC increases the trailer’s body size from 15.7 feet to 22.6 feet. That is quite a roomy area for adventure seekers to put good use to once they park the trailer for a night of rest in a remote location away from civilization. The slide-out area is the master bedroom by default with overhead shelves, and the panoramic dual lights and side windows let plenty of sunshine inside.",
            "This section is separated by a doorway leading to the main cabin which is equally airy having the L-shaped dining lounge behind the kitchenette loaded with a dual-burner gas stove, sink, L-shaped steel counter and 75-L fridge. Here the scissor-lifted table turns into a small bed for a guest or kid. There’s enough space for a private wet bath that has a toilet, sink, and shower. Raptor XC has 160-W solar panels on top that feed the 120-Ah battery, and the 120 L stainless steel tank along with the 100 L wastewater aluminum tank suffice the needs. For a price tag of approximately $43,900, the expandable camper is not a bad deal considering other similar trailers carry a price tag much higher than that!",

Designed to resemble Apple’s newly launched MagSafe Battery Pack (although Abdel came up with this design all the way back in May), the iStorage is a nifty wireless drive that lets you add extra storage to your phone in literally a snap. How would the iStorage even work in theory? Clearly, the MagSafe is built just for hooking accessories to the iPhone and chargers to the wireless charging coil. How would the iStorage even transfer data? Well, even though Abdelrahman’s iStorage is just a fan-made concept, the real device could easily communicate with the iPhone or any other Apple device using AirDrop protocols. The snap-on feature would probably be just something of a convenience, but I could easily imagine the iStorage as being Apple’s own hard drive… something that the company hasn’t really ever worked on.",

The miniature figurine on the front looks stunningly realistic, with a laser-engraved micro-texture on the suit, while the rest of the details are hand-carved and hand-painted to absolute perfection.

That said, the original Ami legal for 14-year-old (or older) drivers, goes at a tops speed of 28 mph and on a single charge goes 44 miles on its 5.5 kWh lithium-ion battery pack. It would be safe to assume Citroën will beef up the battery even more for the off-roading capability.",

In fact, for the 100 glorious years of the brand, late iconic designer Virgil Abloh teamed up with Braun to create a reinterpretation of the 1965 Wandanlage hi-fi audio wall unit.",

Those smooth-flowing lines perfectly balanced out with the voluptuous contours, right from the front section to the rear remind me of the Series 9 Shaver and a hint of the Satin Hair 7 HD785 hairdryer is also apparent. The color scheme and the contours look adapted from the Sixtant SM31 Shaver from 1962.

It’s an experiment in working with wood as an automotive material, and from the looks of it, I wholeheartedly approve! With an aesthetic that reminds me a lot of automotive clay, the custom NIU moped looks decidedly eclectic, earthy, and like an absolute art-piece. Every single element of its body is made by hand from blocks of wood that were finished and assembled in place, and finally finished with brass accents that bring the moped alive, with an old-meets-new steampunk vibe!",

This custom piece, however, shows how a simple material switch can cause an entire aesthetic to get an overhaul. The scooter’s surface-work is entirely the same (there’s no difference in its overall design), but Kalpa Taru’s use of wood elevates the two-wheeler’s design, making it a modern classic. It’s difficult to tell if the scooter’s operational (there’s hardly any information on Kalpa Taru’s website), although one would imagine that blocks of wood are much heavier than formed aluminum or steel sheets, resulting in an e-scooter that has much more weight than it was originally designed to carry.",
            "The moped’s body uses teakwood, a hardwood that Kalpa Taru sources from sustainable government plantations in their town of Bali, Indonesia. A wood often used in ships from back in the day (especially by European voyagers and colonialists), teak today finds itself still being used on decks in yachts, and remains the wood of choice for premium long-lasting furniture. It’s complemented by brass accents that bring out the wood’s earthy color, and add a metallic touch to the bike’s design, which is otherwise dominated by the wood-grain from the teak.",
            "The way Kalpa Taru uses the wood is uniquely fascinating too. Depending on the aerodynamics of the scooter, the wood grain travels in the same direction, giving the illusion of speed. The wood grain shows up as concentric rings around the headlight, an incredibly clever detail, and travels in a linear direction along the sides, creating a bespoke beauty that’s dynamic even when it’s standing still!",

The project was completed in 2020 and exists as a one-off concept for now. It also pushes the boundaries of what wood is capable of as an automotive material. Sure, wood finds itself in car interiors all the time, but this exterior treatment is absolutely exquisite with perfect class A surfacing from the folks at Kalpa Taru.

The electric truck has a very out-of-the-box design which looks nothing like we’ve seen so far. Even the Volvo Vera, Tesla Semi, or the Ford F-Vision look a tad ordinary in comparison to this one.

On the road, these wheels move independently to the tractor pulling it up ahead, which also has a set of independently moving wheels to maneuver the turns and tight spaces for practicality. The ride height of the trailer is not high enough for it to tread the uneven terrains and the sole set of big wheels poses another challenge for flexibility on banked roads or swapping it with another set of wheels in case the existing ones go rouge.

Hence comes into the equation the wave of eVTOL aircrafts that are capable of take-off and landing without the need of an airstrip or even level ground for that matter. This prompted a team of visionary thinkers to create an African tailored solution for the lingering African predicament. PHRACTYL, as the start-up is known is working on developing a personal aerial vehicle christened Macrobat. It’s named so because bats are the only flying mammals on the planet, and this pelican-shaped air mobility solution is also unique in its own rights.",

The tracks at the feet, the bird-like legs and the piloting/passenger cabin – all carry an element of the eerily cool. The Macrobat looks to have landed straight out of a sci-fi flick that’s mashed up a eVTOL and a technologically evolved robotic bird with enhanced consciousness. Multi-tracked feet of the mythical-looking bird means it can land on any terrain without hitch. The designers have taken a bold leap to give the flying machine a set of strong legs with hip, knee and ankle joints actuated by pretty strong motors. Once in the air, these legs will fold up to minimize any aerodynamic interference.",
            "While landing down and taking off, the Macrobat will tilt back by around 45 degrees – just like most birds do. How the developers will address the weight distribution of the aircraft given all the different sets of variables like – weather conditions, wind speeds, the weight of the passenger/cargo or pilot error – is a question for another day. According to PHRACTYL, they can swap the design of the propellers seen here for a smaller form factor in future prototype designs. For the initial concept design, they claim the single-seater eVTOL to go at a speed of 112 mph and an average range of 93 miles. It will be able to carry a maximum load of 150 kg – be it the pilot, passenger or cargo. Yes, it can be piloted remotely too, so a passenger can sit back and enjoy the ride!",

Meet the Porsche Neuro, a radical racecar imagined for an era of metaverses, space-travel, cyborgs, and advanced tech. Quite unlike any car I’ve ever seen (including even the futuristic concepts), the Neuro’s body is divided into three parts – an exterior protective shell, an inner structure that morphs to make the car more aerodynamic, and an egg-shaped interior cabin that sits within the car as a tertiary unit, serving as the cockpit. Moreover, the cockpit is an entirely enclosed structure that provides the driver with a narrow view of what’s in front… so the Neuro also comes with a pair of camera-equipped drones that sit inside the car’s body, popping out and driving right behind the car to live stream a third-person view to the driver, allowing them to effectively choose between first and third-person driving.",
            "Envisioned by Korea-based automotive designer Joon-yeop Bae, the Neuro concept boasts of quite a few radical automotive innovations, the most noteworthy being the car’s body itself. Inspired by the biomechanics of a frog, the car comes with a body that shape-shifts, alternating between different stances. The wheels on the Neuro move independent of the car’s cabin, popping out sideways in ‘frog mode’ or receding inward into the car’s body in ‘tadpole mode’. These two modes allow the car to either cover more ground, making it highly maneuverable on curved roads, or reduce the track width to make the car more aerodynamic on straight roads. The addition of spherical wheels are fairly futuristic too, allowing the car to have multiple degrees of freedom as it races down the track.",
            "Perhaps the most unusual aspect of the Neuro’s design is the inclusion of drones, which follow the car from the back. Docked in special compartments near the rear wheel flaps (which double as spoilers to increase downforce), the drones pop out to offer a ‘multi perspective’ driving experience that allows drivers to view their cars as they would in a video game, offering a unique perspective that makes racing easier and much more thrilling. The drones also unlock the ability for the car to be controlled remotely, allowing the driver to operate the car without being seated within it.

            "The “NoMad” – a light and resistant vehicle that is presented as a fusion between a traditional tent and a futuristic-looking van designed by the ABIBOO Studio. Each NoMad creates this balance by designing 3 unique compartments – a wet area that holds the kitchen and bathroom, a living room/guest room/workroom, and thirdly a master bedroom that separates from to living room to help you disconnect at the end of the day. The layout of the trailer holds the wet area at the center of the design, automatically creating a barrier/ separation between the living room and the bedroom. Given the space constraints, every bit in the vehicle design holds storage space and hidden seating space. Smart use of terraces means we can leverage the outside space once the trailer is settled in.",
            "The Bailey Discovery D4-2 Camper Trailer is designed for adventurers who love their space. The USP of this camper trailer is its inflatable awning which creates almost double the private space you need for your escapades under the star-studded nights. On the inside, D4-2 is equipped with all the amenities and a fully furnished interior. The best part about that expanded area – the transparent panel that allows plenty of sunshine and light while keeping those pesky mosquitoes away.",
            "The Red Dot Design Award 2021 winning Whale Trailer Cabin, which as the name suggests derives shape from the marine animal, comes with a gradient marine blue and white color exterior. From the images, the white interior of the trailer blends well with the exterior color scheme and adds to the luxe. The concept separates the sleeping, living, and eating areas and has an extending awning at the back that offers more covered outdoor space to be utilized. When you want to grab a bite, the hideaway kitchen on the front can be pulled out giving you a complete kitchen to your disposal. In the middle is the living area with a pop-top roof opening up space for more headroom and natural light.",
            "Inspired by the mobile lifestyle and the movement of wind, Wrocław-based architecture and interior design firm Znamy sie constructed Good Spot, Poland’s first mobile hotel chain concept that transforms disused isothermal refrigerated semi-trailers into two-bedroom mobile campers. Following a kitesurfing trip in Poland’s coastal town of Hel, the designers at Znamy sie set out to conceptualize a mobile hotel chain designed for guests to travel wherever the wind brings them. Honing in on the hotel’s mobility concept, Znamy sie first coated each dilapidated isothermal refrigerated semi-trailer with a stainless steel exterior similar to the Airstream caravan. Inside each trailer, the designers outfitted the perimeter with all of the amenities and functional elements found in hotels.",
            "This is the RV2035 towable trailer designed to be aerodynamic for minimal impact on the road and fully compatible with electric vehicles that are centered on performance and maximum range. When on the road, this trailer having a tight turning radius is a compact capsule behind an EV, but as soon as it arrives at the resting destination, there’s another side to the rig. It opens up to expand the usable space to 120 sq. ft. as the raised roof and tent provide around 7 feet of headroom. Keeping in tune with nature the wing cantilever a few inches above the ground preserves the integrity of the natural habitat underneath.",
            "On the outside, the EXP-8 is a fortress with an insulated body and a waterproof chassis.  To take on any demanding terrain, the off-road trailer has an independent moving suspension system aided by the big 37-inch mud-terrain wheels. This means a stable ride inside, even though you’ll be treading the most demanding scalable landscape on the face of the planet. The rig will have its own water purifications system and a 1,600-W solar energy array on the roof connected to a 2.5kWh battery pack for electricity needs. For backup, there is a 5,000-W inverter as well. According to Bruder, the trailer will also have a reverse-osmosis system to purify water from natural sources, so that hardcore explorers never ever run out of drinking water.",
            "Ten years after the Temporary Living competition, De Markies saw its first prototype and received 1996’s Rotterdam Design Prize’s Public Prize for it. Fast forward to 2021 and De Markies is still turning heads. Built with accordion-like expansions, De Markies’s shape begins as a cubic camper on the road and triples in size to form a complete semicircle. Once De Markies expands into its final shape, the camper’s main bedroom can be found inside of its opaque orange awning, while a sunroom comes into shape underneath the van’s transparent awning. Inside the caravan, a kitchen, bathroom, and sitting room come with all the amenities needed for a comfortable retreat on the road, including a stove, sink, countertop, storage space, and tables.",
            "Lightweight, modern teardrop trailers hit the market very frequently these days. Despite that, there is always scope for something like the Droplet XL, an insulated, spacious, and naturally well-lit camper for weekend RVers, urban dwellers, and pro campers alike. After entering the market with Droplet 58, a small trailer with a big impact, the trailer manufacturer is back with the next version called the Droplet XL. This is a bright and modern insulated trailer with a queen-size bed and a fully equipped kitchen. Based on a powder-coated steel chassis, the trailer is made from a wood-fiber frame overlaid by aluminum composite skin, and in between the two layers is the closed-cell foam for insulation.",
            "This design is a concept prototype stage –developed by Kip in close quarters with the designer Karel Bodegom, the Netherlands Bureau for Tourism and Conventions (NBTC), and a number of Dutch suppliers. The large windows of Panorama Shelter blur the divide between the cozy inside and the tranquil outside. Windows make up the chunk of the sidewalls, a skylight brings in ample sunlight during the noon, the big front door is majorly glass, and the side facing the vehicle too has a huge panoramic window. For times when you need total privacy, there are integrated blackout and roller screens. The pop-up roof can be pushed up a little to let in ambient sounds. The teardrop comes with a flexible kitchen for indoor and outdoor cooking and a sink faucet that also functions as an outdoor shower. An induction cooktop too draws power from an onboard 240-V power outlet and a mini-fridge to store all the eatables. The stow-away portable toilet suffices the daily needs for an extended trip.",
            "Bradbuilds is a Los Angeles-based concept artist who reimagines many automotive designs with a crazy twist. Apart from the BMW M4 camper, his other viral works include a Tesla roadster safari as well. BMW is associated with luxury, not with adventure but this concept really turns the brand image on its head to give us a sporty yet sleek coupe camper. To accommodate the trailer, the designer has taken out the backseat from the car and optimized it for time off the grid. The vehicle is a 500 horsepower single-bed camper. The interiors include all elements ideally needed for a road trip – a bed, a pair of solar panels, and a kitchenette. The suspension has been lifted and the tires have been replaced with robust BFGoodrich ones which makes it ready to take the road less traveled."

            "Since the start of stay-at-home orders, campers have made quite the comeback in the world of modern camping. The campers coming out from recent years have been some of the most versatile and compact designs we’ve seen in years. A few years back and ahead of its time, Dutch architect Eduard Böhtling submitted his transforming De Markies camper design to 1985’s Temporary Living architecture competition. The type of camper that can be reintroduced in years to come and still send a tingle down any camper’s spine, De Markies is a tiny home on wheels that can triple in size with the push of a button.",

            "Constructed to withstand most elements, Böhtling found durability in plastic cladding for De Markies’s roof. Unfurled into its semicircular shape, the awnings find privacy on one side through an opaque orange plastic covering, and a sun-soaked room on the other side with a transparent plastic covering. Slated for next year’s Geneva Architecture Exhibition, De Markies is still making its rounds.",

            "A sports car built around the sleek prowling stance of one of the fastest animals on the planet. A set of wheels that you’d want to ride the city on an autumn night!",
            "The future is going to be wild, and so will be the automobiles in a few decades. While we’ve come across countless concepts that are crazy enough to envision what’s to come, some go the extra mile in making us all believe what’s coming. Likewise, the GAC U concept by car exterior designer Anthony Zhao is a spitting image of the future commuting – dominated by exquisite shapes and sporty character.",
            "The two-seater concept here is a sports car that doesn’t pursue speed, rather, it zooms in on the experience of riding a flamboyant vehicle in a slightly laid-back position to enjoy the view all around. It does have an entry and exit mechanism like the drag racing monsters – the Top Fuel dragsters that are commonly referred to as the kings of sports. Claustrophobic riders should stay clear of this elegant racing machine though, it has very constricted interior space that’s completely encapsulated by the panoramic glass windshield.",
            "Inspiration for the core design is from the stance of a leopard when it is prying on its next meal. That’s very much evident in the low front position and the high rear section. It makes sense from the seating comfort perspective as well, since the driver has a slightly higher head position to get an optimum view of the road ahead. The car has no bumper, in fact, the windshield is the bumper and vice-versa. This expands the heads-up view of the road ahead. The GAC-U concept has a very low ride height (understandable as it’s a sports car), so other than the race track, you can only think of taking it for a spin in a metropolis with smooth roads.",
            "The big wheels and the simple geometric-influenced design of the concept are a treat for the eyes. Anthony has created a mock-up design of the concept sports car and we absolutely love it. We do want to see it in the real-sized version – a prototype someday!",
